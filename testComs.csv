"Can you beat some of the lines in this film? As a guy, which I am, I identified with Harry&#39; s lines so much, and you can&#39; t help but side with him. The chemistry between the two actors, Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan is superb, and you believe in them when they talk, you feel for them when they look at each other. Even the friends are well casted, Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby. It&#39; s such relaxed acting and filming that you do nothing but watch these people fall in love, and pretty soon you feel like you&#39; re involved as well. With a fantastic soundtrack, direction, script and acting, it&#39; s a great film. ",9
"Not too long ago I finally got around to seeing this film, I&#39; d heard so much about it that I had to see it. After seeing it the first time I thought it was good, but I have to say that I liked it even more on my second viewing. The film is absolutely wonderful! The story is very amusing and keeps you interested in the characters from start to finish. <br/><br/>I literally couldn&#39; t wait to see what would happen in the next scene. This is one of those movies that goes by very quickly. I think that&#39; s a sign of a good movie, when you just can&#39; t believe that you&#39; re already an hour or so into the movie. The story really flows nicely from scene to scene. <br/><br/>The cast is great in the film as well. Billy Crystal pulls off one of his best performances, and has a slew of great jokes throughout the film. Meg Ryan looks as beautiful as ever and has such a cute way about her. Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher definitely deserve a great deal of credit too, they both did superb jobs as well. Director Rob Reiner did a great job with the film, keep up the good work Rob. <br/><br/>If you&#39; re into romantic comedies, then you definitely should see this film. Even if you aren&#39; t really into the whole romantic part of it, the comedy is great and worth seeing. I would most definitely recommend seeing this film. <br/><br/>I hope you like it. Thanks for reading, <br/><br/>-Chris",10
"I love romantic comedies, and this may be my all-time favorite. Nora Ephron&#39; s writing is sharp and VERY funny, and the perfect cast delivers the dialogue with flawless timing. I own it on DVD, and will almost invariably turn to it for at least a couple of minutes when I see it in the TV schedule. There are so many priceless moments that I can&#39; t pick out one to highlight; most of them are subtler and funnier than the famous Simulated Orgasm scene. Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher are perfect in their supporting roles, and Rob Reiner&#39; s direction couldn&#39; t be better. I&#39; m afraid that I&#39; m doing nothing but gushing in this review, but great is great, and it&#39; s hard to say anything else. ",10
"&quot; When Harry Met Sally&quot; may not at first seem to be the kind of film that remains classic and timeless. In this very cute exploration of an age-old question: &quot; Can men and women truly just be friends?, &quot; Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan play the kind of characters we have come to love to see them play. No surprises there as they skillfully banter back and forth between adorable, hysterical and morose as the plot rolls on. But upon closer inspection, this film is actually full of nice surprises, including its durability. Watch carefully and you will find one of the best examples of the way an excellent script can propel the plot, character development and pacing of a film perfectly from start to finish. Many lines may seem to be merely entertaining one-liners, but they also serve these other purposes simultaneously. This is a well crafted and well acted script. Even the most dated aspect of the film, the intentional focus on clothing, hair and makeup styles as they change throughout the decades, has taken an unexpected poignancy now that the styles we may remember as current at the time have come to be old-fashioned themselves. The end result is that &quot; When Harry Met Sally&quot; speaks to us if we remember the times portrayed in the film or not. We&#39; re still asking questions about men and women and friendship, and films such as this still help us answer them. ",10
"Aside from freer language and more explicitly sexual humour, When Harry met Sally is a very traditional romantic comedy, very much in the mould established in 1934 by It Happened One Night. Two very different but evenly-matched people are thrown together by circumstance. They are initially hostile to one another, but over the course of the film, this hostility turns to love as their personalities are softened by exposure to their opposites. Indeed, the central traits of Harry and Sally correspond very directly to those of Peter and Ellen in IHON - he worldly-wise and cynical, she spoiled and certain of what&#39; s what. Neither of them, it turns out, is as right or as self-confidant as they believe. What&#39; s very modern about WHMS is its attitude to long-term relationships. It&#39; s no longer enough for the couple simply to fall in love and live happily ever after. They must have a full and real understanding of exactly what, or who, they&#39; re letting themselves in for. They must also be sexually compatible (hence the importance of their having slept with one another before they finally get together). Within this framework of traditional romance in an unromantic world, WHMS is almost perfect. Structurally, there are no gaps or implausibilities. Even the central coincidence of these people running into each other under these circumstances is answered. The short but affecting intermissions of successful old couples describing their relationships are not only crucial to the pacing of the film, they also make the point that Harry and Sally are just another couple with an unusual and interesting story. There&#39; s an element of luck and coincidence in every successful relationship. The effectiveness of the film&#39; s structure is perhaps best highlighted by the soundtrack. There&#39; s a perfectly selected Louis Armstrong track for every phase of their relationship - the soundtrack not only complements the mood of the film, it comments on the action. The acting is superb, with the two main protagonists as well as their two foils (Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher) all giving career-best comic performances. Without such fantastic performances, it&#39; s very possible that the film could have failed: these are essentially self-indulgent people, that we sympathise with them and recognise them is in great measure down to the stars. Finally, the script is fantastic. Of course nobody really speaks like that, but like all great scripts it distills emotions and points of view into a few lines. And it&#39; s funny. The one-liners are still sharp and amusing on the twentieth viewing, and the set-pieces are beautifully realised (the orgasm scene is only the most famous - check out Harry&#39; s olympic sex-dream speech - &quot; Must have been the dismount&quot; - or the &quot; I&#39; m through making a schmuck out of myself&quot; phone call). All this, and a dinner party talking point about male and female relationships. Can we ever be just friends? Not even with an ugly girl? &quot; Nah, you pretty much want to nail them too. &quot; ",9
"This is Billy Crystal&#39; s show.  He has an understated, ordinary, humble screen presence.  It&#39; s not the case that every single line HAS to be funny in order for us to like him - with Crystal, a joke can fall flat and somehow it doesn&#39; t make him personally look bad.  But here every line IS funny, so he has charm to burn. <br/><br/>I know people like Meg Ryan - I guess I do, too, in this particular film - and I know that there are people who find her `orgasm&#39; scene amusing, but Sally is really just someone for Harry to meet and ultimately fall in love with.  She&#39; s completely clueless.  Most of the jokes are at her expense rather than his.  The genuine wit, the power of observation, the theoretical insight, all lie with Harry.  Is this a problem?  Not in the least.  Unlike most romantic comedies this is not some kind of duel - it&#39; s the more realistic study of many, many separate encounters. <br/><br/>Also unlike most romantic comedies, this one is funny.  I think I mentioned that. <br/><br/>The film benefits from its second rank support: good performances by Carrie Fischer and that guy whose name doesn&#39; t matter, locations someone actually went to some trouble to look for, and a song-score that is doesn&#39; t intrude and hit us repeatedly over the head.  Allegedly `When Harry Met Sally&#39; has been imitated by later productions, but I can&#39; t think of a case where the imitation is accurate enough to even be recognisable. ",9
I decided to watch this for the first time and thought it was one of the most realistic romance movies that there is. It is also really cute with showing older couples between the scenes and hearing their love at first sight stories. <br/><br/>,8
"&quot; I came here tonight because when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible. &quot; <br/><br/>My favorite Rob Reiner film has always been When Harry Met Sally, a romantic comedy that I never expected to enjoy as much as I did. It&#39; s the best Woody Allen film not directed by Woody Allen. Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal&#39; s quirky chemistry in this movie is probably one of the best I&#39; ve seen in any film. Reiner is a director that is hard to categorize since he has worked with different genres: thriller with Misery, fantasy/adventure with The Princess Bride, coming of age with Stand by Me, mockumentary with This is Spinal Tap, drama with A Few Good Men, and comedy with The Bucket List. He&#39; s made his share of bad films (his latest films are probably his weakest), but he seems to have excelled in every genre without establishing a common trademark. You could watch When Harry Met Sally back to back with Misery and you&#39; d never guess it was directed by the same person. The secret to his success with this rom-com is that the relationship feels true to life as he first introduces these flawed characters that don&#39; t seem to care too much for each other, but over the years they begin bonding and establishing a strong friendship. These characters are so relatable and we can see ourselves or our friends in the film. It reminds us of that friend of the opposite sex we had and how easy it was to blur the line between friendship and love. It makes us think of that universal question: Can a man and a woman be best friends without falling in love with each other? A lot of credit must be given to Nora Ephron&#39; s Oscar nominated screenplay because the dialogue and debates between the main characters are authentic and sharp at the same time. There are so many memorable scenes, including the fake orgasm which turned Meg Ryan into such a star, but the final tear jerking scene is my favorite because Billy Crystal delivered his lines in such a perfect way. Even the scenes where old couples are being interviewed in documentary style works perfectly and serves a purpose other than simply serving as transitions taking place in the story. The honesty that comes through in each conversation between Harry and Sally and the incredible chemistry between them is what makes this one of my go to films when it comes to recommending a romantic movie. Did I mention that the film takes place in New York of all places? <br/><br/>http: //estebueno10. blogspot. com/",10
"(When Harry Met Sally) discuss an important thing that many people are still arguing about it till this day: Men and Women can&#39; t be Friends. And for the rest of the film it discuss this issue and make it for sure that no man can ever be a friend to a woman due to the sex part between them. <br/><br/>WHMS: is a brilliant comedy with brilliant direction and casting. Starring: Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal, and directed by the fabulous Rob Reiner: most known for (Misery 1990 and Stand by me 1986). <br/><br/>
Meg Ryan made a lot of comedies, but her best performance was in four films (including this one):
<ul><li>Sleepless In Seattle 1993</li><li>When Harry Met Sally 1989</li><li>Joe Versus the Volcano 1990</li><li>You Have Got A Mail 1998</li></ul><br/><br/>She was really amazing here with hair funny facial expressions and her acting is the same style she uses in SIS, so if you love that film I highly recommend this one. <br/><br/>As For Billy Crystal he was funny as usual, he is one of my favorite comedian star of all time, and I don&#39; t think that anyone else could portrayed this role as he did, her really was fabulous. <br/><br/>At the end the film is powerful convincing source that both men and women can&#39; t be friends no matter of what they pretend, someone may disagree with it saying that he or she has a lot of friends from the opposite sex, but the film here is not discussing the normal friendship (which includes dining at the end of the week, or going to a bar and have a drink) it talks about the best friend : so it is impossible to find a best friend female to a guy that goes wherever he goes talks about the smallest details that guys talks about (And the same thing goes for women). <br/><br/>Final Rate:

"AFI 100 Comedies. AFI 100 Passions. AFI 10 Top 10. AFI 100 Quotes. AFI 100 Songs. <br/><br/>&quot; When Harry Met Sally&quot; is easily one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time. It is short in duration, it is extremely watchable, Nora Ephron&#39; s script is hilarious, and Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan both give fantastic performances. There is very little to dislike about this movie if you are looking for entertainment. However, this is in no means an artsy film or a game-changer, but simply something that will definitely put you in a good mood. <br/><br/>When Harry met Sally. . . they hated each other. Their actual meeting for the first time was nothing special at all: Harry&#39; s girlfriend at the start of the movie was a friend of Sally&#39; s, and Sally was simply driving Harry back to New York from college because she lived in New York as well. It only takes a couple of minutes into their journey to New York to make it apparent that the script will be full of philosophical discussion between the two of them (as well as other characters) just like most Richard Linklater films. It is an interesting notion that the main point of Harry&#39; s initial discussion with Sally is that the two of them can never be friends because the &quot; sex stuff&quot; always gets in the way of a man and a woman - yet 10 years after they meet, they become &quot; just friends&quot; (but do we really believe that?). <br/><br/>There is a very creative scene in the movie about two thirds of the way through where a friend of Harry&#39; s and a friend of Sally&#39; s are now a couple, and they are each talking on the phone simultaneously with Harry and Sally respectively. Really interesting editing is applied here to get all four characters on the screen at once, each taking up about a fourth of the screen. It is three separate images, the first image being an image of the couple in bed, and the other two being superimposed images of Harry and Sally on opposite ends of the screen while they are each on the phone. It is one of the most creative scenes in Rob Reiner&#39; s filmography. <br/><br/>Above everything else, &quot; When Harry Met Sally&quot; has a lot of heart, which comes in different forms. It has heart due to its sense of humor, it has heart by showing a lot of emotion between Harry and Sally later in the film, and every now and then, the movie cuts to different couples explaining how they met and when they knew they were meant to be together, putting a smile on the audience member&#39; s face. It is also a joy to watch Harry and Sally grow as people as they become friends (which is against Harry&#39; s initial beliefs) and as they realize their feelings for each other, even if they do not admit those feelings immediately. From the famous &quot; I&#39; ll have what she&#39; s having&quot; moment to the finale at midnight on New Year&#39; s Eve, &quot; When Harry Met Sally&quot; is a triumph of a motion picture, capturing our hearts and holding on throughout. <br/><br/>&quot; When Harry Met Sally&quot; might not be a masterpiece in terms of technicality (it is pretty simply shot and edited aside from that creative scene mentioned above), but it is a film many should experience just for how enjoyable it is. It is a great love story and highly re-watchable. <br/><br/>9/10",9
"Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal are fabulous.
I&#39; ve seen this movie probably 10 times and it just keeps improving with age. ",9
When Harry Met Sally is a classic comedy. It&#39; s from a magical time when Billy Crystal could be a romantic lead and Meg Ryan was adorably not plastic. The dialogue is quick and witty and the characters are believable and likeable. Rob Reiner does a great job capturing the anxieties of friendship and romance. ,7
"Whenever I hear something about him, I wonder; what ever happened to Rob Reiner&#39; s career? What ever happen to that man that could direct any genre? The man who made us cry in &quot; Stand by me&quot; or made us scare to death in &quot; Misery&quot; is now out of the focus. I saw his last film, &quot; Alex &amp; Emma&quot; (which I tried to tolerate because of the actors who starred in it) and it was shameful to see he was promoting it with and advertisement saying: &quot; from the director of&quot; The director of &quot; When Harry met Sally&quot; , this movie, Reiner&#39; s most successful romantic comedy and film ever and by now probably a classic, because of Meg Ryan&#39; s famous scene and because of its general charm. Believe, everything is pink in this film, and the romantic story it proposes is something everyone has experienced. In some ways it reminded me to &quot; The mirror has to faces&quot; , but that couple relationship was totally different. <br/><br/>Here there are two guys in their 20&#39; s, travelling to New York for a better life, arguing about the things they think, do, and expect of their future, and so on. These scenes in the car driving to New York could be extremely boring, but writer Nora Ephron (who would write for Meg Ryan again in &quot; You&#39; ve got mail&quot; ) makes them very interesting. &quot; How can&#39; t you be afraid of death?&quot; , Sally tells Harry, and he answers: &quot; I&#39; m just prepared, when I read a book I always read the ending first in case I die and I can&#39; t finish it&quot; . <br/><br/>Years later that trip is history, and they both have various encounters through the years. She pretends he doesn&#39; t recognize her, because she remembers him perfectly. She was actually captivated by him on that trip but never told him. On the other hand, he pretends to be casual, but hasn&#39; t erased her from his mind; after more than a decade! Soon they start hanging out, telling each other everything, and become best friends; but if you saw them on the street you wouldn&#39; t doubt to think they are a couple. <br/><br/>Why don&#39; t they confess their feelings? You&#39; ve got to see the film to figure it out; you&#39; ve got to witness what happens, how it happens and most importantly why. In our original time, Rob Reiner did this picture more than a decade ago, and he directed it simply and honestly. Without knowing he also brought us one of the first climatic endings in a romantic comedy; those when the guy declares his love in the last minutes, in a powerful touching final speech, you know. <br/><br/>But what he actually got right was the cast. Yes, he got together two actors that achieved a unique chemistry in a movie that needed it entirely. Billy Crystal, showing that way of speaking that is only his and a mark for any good comedian. Rob Reiner helped him to become the super comedic star he was already becoming. And Meg Ryan will be ever grateful to this opportunity that showed her unusual beauty, natural talent and all the other things that would make her the queen of the romantic comedy. ",7
"When Harry Met Sally is one of those films that I was in no way prepared for, which is my favorite kind of new favorite film to watch. Having never seen a Rob Reiner film, I wasn&#39; t sure of his style or technique or how he approached his subjects. I quickly learned through his 1989 feature that he provides a very real look at the lives of people in relationships. When Harry Met Sally tells the tale of a chance meeting between two strangers who then continue to reappear in each other&#39; s lives. The way in which Reiner exposes the truths of finding someone you can best tolerate in a partner, rather than the person that makes your heart turn to mush is a brilliant grasp of how to illustrate the human condition. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan star in the titular roles and provide the brilliant illustration of everyday, flawed human beings often sensationalized for cinema. <br/><br/>Sally (Meg Ryan) agrees to give her friend&#39; s boyfriend, Harry (Billy Crystal) a ride to New York upon their graduation from the University of Chicago. After a long car ride of sharing all the quirky details that make up their existence, completely uninhibited since they are unavailable to each other. After the journey to New York is complete, the two part ways not thinking much of each other. Harry and Sally keep bumping into each other over the years as their lives intersect. They finally decide to maintain a friendship, and quickly become friends and confidants. As they see each other through each successive stage of their lives, it becomes increasingly more difficult to watch the other date. Neither of the two has ever shared such intimate details of their lives, their hopes, fears, and dreams with another person so it only makes sense that the two fall in love. Two people with such neuroses in some ways make a perfect match, but in other ways are their own biggest obstacles in love. <br/><br/>A film that looks and feels this much like Annie Hall is obviously going to rank highly on my list. I had begun writing about the similarities this film shared with Annie Hall, but I soon gave up because there are just too many. The dialogue is fantastic and the entire film is so well-written. Even though the famous line &quot; I&#39; ll have what she&#39; s having. &quot; has worked its way into the American lexicon, it loses nothing when it is spoken. Oftentimes, with a line so popular, the audience member has the &quot; roll-your-eyes-&quot; oh&quot; moment when it&#39; s spoken; but that&#39; s not the case with When Harry Met Sally because the script is so perfect. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan were perfect in their roles, with just enough chemistry to make their unconventional friendship work. Despite how great Meg Ryan was in the role, and also despite the fact that the fate of the universe wouldn&#39; t allow it, I couldn&#39; t help but think all throughout the film how perfect Gilda Radner (R. I. P. ) would have been in the role opposite Crystal. Anyway, When Harry Met Sally is a brilliant look at the lives of real people, and an exceptional film that has already become a new favorite.

"By the late eighties, the romantic comedy as a movie genre had been in a sort of disturbed sleep for twenty years with only an occasional and disappointing movie outing between snores. <br/><br/>Yet when they released &#39; When Harry met Sally&#39; in 1989, it signified to the world that the RomCom was not only out of bed but it was showered, shaved, dressed in a brand new suit and ready to take on the world once more with new found confidence. <br/><br/>It&#39; s 1977 and Harry Burns (Billy Crystal) has just graduated from the University of Chicago and is moving to New York to start his career. He&#39; s a nice enough guy who&#39; s only flaw seems to be his apparent misogynistic and macabre outlook on life. <br/><br/>Also New York bound is fellow graduate Sally Albright (Meg Ryan) who as a favour for a friend agrees to take Harry along. The two have never met before and almost immediately Sally takes a dislike to him. His brash and over flirtatious demeanour irritates her intensely and her quirky prissiness becomes a natural target for his humour. He even sexually propositions her, which she of course rejects outright. <br/><br/>In view of all this coupled with Harry&#39; s somewhat blinkered idea that men and women can never be friends without sexual attraction becoming an issue, they reach New York and mutually call an abrupt halt to their 18 hour friendship, both convinced it has lasted 18 hours too long. <br/><br/>Fast forward five years and Harry and Sally meet again at an airport and when he discovers they are on the same flight, he approaches her to rekindle their friendship and this time things are even worse. <br/><br/>Despite both finding love and success in New York, the years have done nothing to kerb Harry&#39; s sexist and irritating views and Sally&#39; s abject disapproval of everything that he stands for seems even more pronounced. They part once again at journeys end, this time with Sally making it quite clear she wants nothing whatsoever to do with him again. <br/><br/>Another five years pass and both Harry and Sally meet in a bookshop both having recently lost the loves referred to in the previous paragraph. Harry is divorcing his unfaithful wife and Sally has just dumped her long-term relationship as it was becoming clear to her that it was never going to end in an &#39; I Do&#39; . <br/><br/>This time however, possibly due to them both being humbled by recent events in their life, they find that they have empathy with each other and a friendship starts to build, a true platonic friendship to the extent where they finally become inseparable and reliant on each other almost on a brother and sister level. <br/><br/>They partner each other at functions when neither have a date, they set each other up on blind dates and even take day trips together to the museum, and by using each other as an emotional crutch they finally learn to settle the demons of their previous relationships. <br/><br/>It seems like Harry has finally realised and now thoroughly excepts that men and women CAN be friends without a sexual entanglement. In fact so secure are they in their beliefs that they are nothing more than just good friends, they seem completely oblivious to the fact that they have in fact fallen head of heals in love with each other. <br/><br/>Billy Crystal is on fine form in one of his most memorable and hilarious performances and Meg Ryan &#39; Fakes&#39; her way into movie history in that now famous restaurant scene. With great direction by Rob Reiner, a superb script by Nora Ephron and wonderful support from Carrie Fisher and Bruno Kirby, &#39; When Harry Met Sally&#39; is the Crème de la Crème of all the modern day RomComs. ",10
"I&#39; m glad I got to see in the theater for the first time, such a wonderful experience! I absolutely love Billy Crystal and how chatty he was. Such a hilarious enthralling treasure and well written! Nora Ephron the screenwriter should&#39; ve won the Oscar nods, it&#39; s a real shame when that happens. Rob Reiner is a masterful creative director that I truly appreciate!",10
"Often recommended as one of the best romances ever, &quot; When Harry Met Sally. . . &quot; is a completely recommended pick, very funny and having one of the most memorable couples in movie history. <br/><br/>Both Harry and Sally are initially shown as incompatible, almoust oposites, but as the movie goes, we, the audience, realize that their personalities are actually complementary. Their conversations become more emotive and intimate with time, both changing to become better and the good cinematography emphatizes that; specially with details as the multiple split camera scenes (which seemed to be the hardest to film). <br/><br/>Talking about the singular elements, the script is amazing, one of the best in the genre, the movie has a lot of quotable lines itself, but that doesn&#39; t define a good script, but rather the smoothness in their conversations and -a very important thing- self-refering quotes that -like a postmodern book- criticize constructively the stereotypes in both the fictional and real romance (with data as the &quot; fake ; rate or the male/female frienships). This kind of elements give an intelligent aspect to an already enjoyable tape, but of course, it all reduces to that question: is it worth your time? To which I assure you it is. ",8
I liked it when I first saw it and enjoyed it recently. It has aged well!,8
This was proably the first rom com I had ever watched and I loved it. Since then I have seen many other rom coms but never can they beat this classic. A perfect combination of humour and romance. The dialogue is memorable and the actor&#39; s have amazing chemistry. You really believe in there love story. I recommend it to any one who calls themself a fan of the rom com genre. ,10
"&quot; She&#39; s out of My League&quot; is a solid 7, a romantic comedy that scores a few good laughs and does a nice job of being convincing. Jay Baruchel (Tropic Thunder) stars as Kirk, a pathetic dork with the build of Woody Allen who works a menial job in airport security. Through a cell-phone mishap, he winds up at a party being thrown by Molly (Alice Eve), a 10 on the very attractive scale. He knows she&#39; s way more attractive than him and she knows he&#39; s normally not the guy she would usually date but Molly looks deep down and sees Kirk for the nice, unthreatening guy he is and they hit it off. There are some funny moments here. Kirk&#39; s family is especially demeaning to him (they even embrace his bitchy ex-girlfriend as one of their own) and his friends are clueless match-makers, which leads to a very funny man-scaping scene between Kirk and one of them. What works best in &quot; League&quot; is just listening to people talk though. Kirk&#39; s friends (played by Mike Vogel, Nate Torrance, and T. J Miller) are identifiable idiots, too wrapped up in over-thinking things like the rating scale (both their number and womens) and Disney fairy-tales to really understand women. Their scenes with Kirk are enjoyably like a crude, vulgar, sexual &quot; Breakfast Club&quot; . The way the scrawny, nervous, and unconfident Baruchel interacts with the beautiful and engaging Eve is also very likable and they do a nice job of handling the ups and downs of forming an honest, meaningful relationship (an almost foreign concept in today&#39; s star-packaged romantic comedies). The way they finally handle the elephant in the room is also very effective. This is feel-good stuff, but it works. ",7
"Expectations weren&#39; t exactly through the roof for SOOML. No big name actors, a director with no feature film experience and a screenplay by the same guys who brought us Sex Drive. It is with great delight then, that what we get is 100 minutes of laughter and light-hearted entertainment. Is it clichéd? Sure is. We&#39; ve seen the &#39; underdog gets the girl&#39; story repetitively since the dawn of cinema, but at least scripters John Morris and Sean Anders inject it with humorous variations to ensure we forgive their shortcomings in originality. <br/><br/>Jay Baruchel was another unknown quantity. His supporting turns in Knocked Up, Fanboys, Tropic Thunder and Million Dollar Baby (remember the weakling who frequented the boxing hall despite his complete lack of talent – that was Baruchel) have provided laughs galore, but being the main star is different altogether. His geeky exterior and small frame isn&#39; t exactly leading man material however Baruchel&#39; s great comic timing and willingness to make a fool of himself if required makes him a likable headliner. <br/><br/>On the opposite end of the gender pole is the drop-dead gorgeous Alice Eve who, like Molly, is a hard ten. It&#39; s not just her looks that makes her popular with the men though, she&#39; s genuinely cool and doesn&#39; t have a whiff of ego. Elsewhere in the cast you&#39; ll find the previously unknown T. J. Miller as Kirk&#39; s best mate Stainer – a character who resembles Napoleon Dynamite if he were on crack cocaine – who delivers a handful of memorable one-liners and plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. <br/><br/>A charismatic cast and some hilarious jokes makes this a surprising winner. <br/><br/>3. 5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",7
"(Synopsis) Molly (Alice Eve) is a sexy event planner who is delayed by a sleazy airport security guard. Another security guard, Kirk (Jay Baruchel) comes to her rescue, and passes her through to catch her plane. Luckily, Kirk finds Molly&#39; s phone that she left behind, and from the plane, Molly calls her phone and invites Kirk to a party to return her phone when she returns. Kirk is smitten by Molly, but his friends point out to him that he doesn&#39; t have a chance, because he is only rated as a &quot; 5&quot; and Molly is definitely a &quot; 10&quot; . And as everybody knows, you can only date a girl who is only &quot; 2&quot; above your score, so that means Kirk can only successfully date a &quot; 7&quot; . However, Molly has something else in mind, because she has found that Kirk is sweet, amusing, honest, and different from the men she has been dating. Kirk, on the other hand, has one big insecurity problem; Kirk believes Molly will dump him as soon as she realizes her mistake. Under these circumstances, and everything working against Kirk and Molly, is it possible for them to build a relationship that will bloom and flourish? <br/><br/>(My Comment) This is an unlikely love story that is a really sweet romantic comedy. You would think that it is a women&#39; s movie, but it actually is a guy&#39; s movie, because it gives the &quot; 5s&quot; of the world the belief that they have a chance to catch and have a relationship with a &quot; 10&quot; . The trailers portray that there are a lot of raunchy sex scenes in the movie, but actually, it is more your imagination then the real thing. The story does show and prove that a person with low self esteem will have a hard time in life fulfilling his dream. Hopefully, people who saw this movie will take this lesson of life to heart and go for the gold, or in this case a &quot; 10&quot; . Jay Baruchel&#39; s performance as the quirky geek was right on target, and Alice Eve&#39; s portrayal of Molly made her very likable. Both actors characterization of the low self-image problem was very believable. This is one of those hilariously funny love stories that could be a sleeper hit. I laughed throughout the whole movie, and left the movie in a happy mood. (Paramount, Run Time 1: 44, Rated R)(7/10)",7
"In all honesty, I have no idea why I went to see this movie. It clearly falls in one of the most clichéd of all film genres and stars only one person I have ever heard of. But I went to see it anyway and I was glad I did. <br/><br/>I think I liked it mostly because of the leads. I liked the guy because he never tried to impress the girl, he was just himself, even when it was painful and difficult to do so, and I liked the girl because once you got past her looks, you found an interesting person underneath. <br/><br/>The other big reason I liked it was because it managed to take one of the oldest romantic clichés ever--racing to the airport to declare your love before that Perfect Someone leaves--and put a nice twist on it. Kudos to the writers on that one, that alone was worth several points on this scale. <br/><br/>This is actually one of the better movies I&#39; ve seen this year, I highly recommend it. ",8
"I mean She&#39; s Out of My League is right up there with The 40 year old Virgin(2005), and I Love You, Man(2009), a raunchy vulgar comedy that manages to have a heart to it. I mean Role Models(2008), hardly had anybody likable in it, and it was a big hit, and i&#39; m still trying to figure that one out. But this film had two likable leads that you wanna route for. <br/><br/>Kirk(Jay Baruchel from Knocked Up), works at at an airport, he&#39; s a nice guy, but painfully shy and insecure. His buddies that he works with say thats because women don&#39; t consider him boyfriend material, cause he is too safe. But all that changes one day when the ever so enchantingly beautiful Molly(Alice Eve) forgets her cell phone, while boarding a plane, she uses her friends cell phone to call her cell phone, and Kirk finds it and answers it, she asks him can he hold it for her. Kirk brings it back to her, Alice soon wants to spend more time with Kirk. But will Kirk insecurities ruin it? <br/><br/>The critics are quick to bash this movie, but give Role Models a thumbs up, go figure. I liked Jay Baruchel and Alice Eve they where characters to route for, and where very enjoyable to watch, although Baruchel was more funnier then Eve, the comedy just happened around her. Lindsay Sloane(Big Red from Bring It On) is also good has Marnie, Kirks ex. Krysten Ritter is also amusing as Patty, Mollys friend. But the real scene stealer IS T. J. Miller has Kirks friend Stainer, who steals almost every moment when every scene he is in, he&#39; s like Jason Segal and Seth Rogen mixed together. <br/><br/>I say don&#39; t listen to the critics, see this movie and form your own opinion.

"I saw this at a sneak preview showing knowing very little about the film other than one preview. <br/><br/>This film is along the same lines as &quot; Knocked Up&quot; or &quot; Superbad&quot; in that it is rather funny, but at the same time makes you relate to the characters in a way that also tugs at your heart. There were many times when the theater full of people burst into laughter, and I even found myself crying at some points I was laughing so hard! The actors all do a fantastic job with their parts, and you can easily identify with most of them. (No &quot; over the top&quot; characters ever do a hostile takeover of the plot. ) This movie is probably a notch below movies like &quot; The Hangover, &quot; &quot; The 40 Year Old Virgin&quot; and &quot; Wedding Crashers, &quot; but it definitely holds it own and you will most definitely find yourself laughing hard more than once. Well worth the $$ to see it in the theater!",8
"&quot; Do you even know how hot you are?&quot; <br/><br/>She&#39; s out of My League is a fairly typical comedy. Jay Baruchel plays an utterly average guy named Kirk, who is nothing more than mediocre in every aspect of his life, career, and looks. When a chance encounter leads to him meeting Molly (Alice Eve), a nearly- flawless woman (seriously, she&#39; s gorgeous in this movie) who seems interested in him despite all odds, Kirk has to deal with the new experience of being a 5 who&#39; s dating a hard 10. <br/><br/>So yeah, that&#39; s not exactly a fresh, new story. That can be forgiven in a comedy, as long as it&#39; s. . well, comedic. The movie manages to be pretty funny at times, but a lot of the humor is hit or miss. Something hilarious would happen, and then you&#39; ll spend the next five minutes wondering whether what you&#39; re seeing is supposed to be funny or not. Jay has been much funnier in other movies, and the supporting cast wavers between humorous and annoying. Still, the jokes in She&#39; s out of my League succeed more often than they fail. <br/><br/>The relationship between Kirk and Molly is a little hard to swallow at times, because she seems so determined to like him. Even though Kirk&#39; s personality in the movie isn&#39; t particularly remarkable. You actually start to believe their friends when they&#39; re constantly telling them that they&#39; re not going to work as a couple. The inevitable circumstances that cause problems for them seem extremely forced and predictable, as is their eventual reunion. There&#39; s little imagination involved in the story, that&#39; s for sure. <br/><br/>It probably seems like I didn&#39; t particularly like the movie, but I did. It was quite funny in parts, and even the most generic parts of it weren&#39; t bad - just overly familiar. This isn&#39; t a bad comedy to check out, I just wouldn&#39; t go so far as to recommend buying it. ",6
"I just got back from seeing this movie, and I have to admit that I really enjoyed it. Possibly because I wasn&#39; t expecting to, but I also wasn&#39; t against giving it a chance. To me, the commercials did not look very promising, and when it was compared to the hangover in one ad, I really wasn&#39; t expecting much. First of all, when I went to see the hangover, I was ready to laugh like crazy due to how funny everyone said it was. Personally, I didn&#39; t find it very funny at all and I always felt the writers/actors were trying too hard make a joke out of everything. The only thing that kept my attention was the semi-interesting plot. <br/><br/>I found the ads for She&#39; s Out of My League to be promising a &quot; hangover clone&quot; (in terms of the type of humor). Thankfully this movie is not what it appears to be. Many will disagree, but I felt that there is more reason for watching this than for a constant need to be funny and outrageous. I also liked the character in this movie, and found they added a lot to the story. <br/><br/>Although this movie offers nothing we haven&#39; t seen before, I found it at least to be enjoyable. Another reason I liked this movie is because I felt there was a storyline that made up for most of the jokes I didn&#39; t find funny. <br/><br/>I know that most will find it to be a pointless movie (and I guess it is to an extent), but I found it to be entertaining and worth seeing. I&#39; m glad I wasn&#39; t expecting to be laughing throughout the whole movie, because I didn&#39; t, and because I found it to be a little more than what I was expecting from the plot. ",8
"I went into the early screening of this movie tonight with low expectations, having not heard much about the movie, nor seen any trailers. I was floored! The cast is great in their parts and the script is hilarious. If you like any of the Judd Apatow films (I don&#39; t think he was a part of this movie, but it is the same kind of humor) then you will like this one. Fans of Knocked Up will recognize Jay BarucheI who plays the awkward lead with weak self esteem, and he is as cute as ever. I also had a chance to meet the lovely Alice Eve, who attended the screening and she was very nice and very beautiful. I hope to see more of her in the future. While this wasn&#39; t Shakespeare, it was a great laugh and very fun to see with friends. ",8
"In Pittsburgh, the clumsy and average Kirk (Jay Baruchel) works as a TSA security agent at the airport. Kirk is out of shape, uncoordinated, not college graduate, has never been in Europe and drives a shitbox Neon. His friends are a bunch of losers that also work at the airport and use to rank themselves and women. His family does not support him and his father used his college money to build a large swimming pool in the backyard of their house. Kirk dreams on becoming an airplane pilot, but he is insecure and without self-esteem. He also misses his former girlfriend Marnie (Lindsay Sloane), who is a bitch that humiliate him all the time. <br/><br/>One day, the gorgeous Molly McCleish (Alice Eve) is helped by him in the check-in to a flight to New York, but she forgets her iphone and Kirk holds it for her. On the next day, Molly invites Kirk to go to a party at the Andy Warhol Museum and he delivers her iphone to her. Sooner they date and he learns that she is a successful promoter of events that lives in a fancy apartment and drives a nice car. However, the lack of confidence of Kirk does not let him see that Molly loves him since she is totally out of his league. <br/><br/>The delightful &quot; She&#39; s Out of My League&quot; is one of the funniest comedies I have recently seen. Jay Baruchel is hilarious in the role of a man that has no self-esteem and self-confidence to be happy with one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen, Alice Eve, who is really a pretty woman. <br/><br/>Alice Eve was ranked #7 in 2010 in the &quot; Beautiful Famous Faces&quot; by &quot; The Annual Independent Critics List of the 100 Most Beautiful Famous Faces From Around the World. &quot; My vote is seven. <br/><br/>Title (Brazil): &quot; Ela é Demais para Mim&quot; (&quot; She is Out of My League&quot; )",7
"&#39; SHE&#39; S OUT OF MY LEAGUE&#39; : Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>Sean Anders and John Morris, the writing team behind &#39; SEX DRIVE&#39; (which Anders also directed and I thought was one of the best comedies in recent years) and the upcoming &#39; HOT TUB TIME MACHINE&#39; , wrote this hilarious comedy that is emotionally touching and inspiring as well. This seems to be the writing teams knack and they&#39; re proving to rival the likes of Judd Apatow and Kevin Smith, which previously had the market cornered on intelligent yet crude and vulgar comedies that also prove to be well made and heart felt character studies as well. <br/><br/>The duo, at least so far, have also centered on subject matter revolving around the social outcast &#39; loveable loser&#39; finally winning out and succeeding in life (most notably by winning over the girl of his dreams, who&#39; s way out of his league). This is probably a really relate-able subject matter for their target audience which is why their films (at least the first two) have been such a success. Sort of the same area of expertise Smith and Apatow also have and have had great success in. <br/><br/>This movie fits the writing team&#39; s known formula to a T and tells the story of a pretty average looking &#39; loveable loser&#39; named Kirk (played by Jay Baruchel, a known Apatow collaborator) who manages to impress a stunningly beautiful woman named Molly (played by newcomer Alice Eve) with his kindness. Molly&#39; s on the rebound from a bad break-up with a cocky good looking pilot (played by Geoff Stults) and due to the fact that Kirk seems &#39; safe&#39; and harmless she asks him out. The two actually hit it off but due to Kirk&#39; s lack of confidence (due in large part to his best friends&#39; constant put downs and demoralizing abuse, which is probably a relate-able subject for a lot of target viewers as well – it is for me) he loses faith in himself and unintentionally sabotages his chances with her. <br/><br/>The movie is actually a pretty smart and clever character study and it&#39; s definitely inspiring, although it is also pretty far fetched; that a ten would go for a five, as the movie&#39; s tag-line states. Despite the insight and heart the movie does deliver on all the low brow belly laughs that the previews promise and there&#39; s a lot of really clever &#39; Smith-esque&#39; dialog as well.

"The path of this romantic comedy is well trodden - loser Kirk is asked out by gorgeous Molly because she is weary of bad treatment from the hunks she normally dates, and he seems safe. He&#39; s actually a nice guy, and she falls for him. However, his friend Stainer has been driving home the message that he is way below her status (both socially and in terms of looks) and it will never succeed, and her friend Patty has been doing the same with her. This eventually drives them apart, at which point the friends realise the mistake they&#39; ve made and conspire to bring them together again. <br/><br/>I&#39; m not familiar with Jay Baruchel (Kirk) other than as the voice of the main character in How To Train Your Dragon. But, on the basis of She&#39; s Out Of My League, he appears to be vying with Michael Cera and Jesse Eisenberg for the position of Self-denigrating Loser Unlikely Romantic Hero. <br/><br/>And he is doing so quite successfully in this case, because the object of his affections is played by Alice Eve, another performer with whom I am unfamiliar but about whom I will say she is very attractive (of course, that&#39; s the point of the movie) and she has a great smile. I wasn&#39; t familiar with much of the supporting cast, either, but they were all good - interestingly, Molly&#39; s parents are played by her real life parents, English actors Trevor (Shoestring) Eve and Sharon (Gold Blend commercials) Maughan. I particularly liked Krysten Ritter as Molly&#39; s friend Patty, and Debra Jo Rupp as Kirk&#39; s mother. <br/><br/>As is the modern fashion there is a fair amount of bad language, and some concentration on bodily functions (one of which gives rise to one of the funniest sequences in the film). But these are nice people and it&#39; s quite a sweet story, and the ruderies fit quite well, so I didn&#39; t mind that much. <br/><br/>I liked this film. ",8
"This movie probably had some potential for something; my bewilderment is how these utterly prosaic unfunny themes keep making it to theaters, it&#39; s as if ideas are being recycled just because generations are. Truly the decerebrate oafs behind most films are like dogs, they return to ingest their own vomit. Well, they&#39; re 19 bucks richer now because of me. This was not at all imaginative, there was no redeeming moment, anything remotely funny was shown in the trailer (and nothing amusing was in the trailer), performances were strained (especially Molly&#39; s, totally unconvincing). What was theoretically supposed to be some comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a penchant for Disney films; none of his analogies hit home, his little moral speeches were flat, I was literally waiting for them to go on to say something meaningful, only to find out he was done. The so-called &quot; hard 10&quot; is the most insipid plastic creature there is (apart from having a horse-like face with a weird smile); I honestly found her friend Patty (referred to as the Hamburglar) to be much better looking than her. But then again, gentlemen prefer brunettes ; ) Well, anyway, the whole premise is that society is superficial and if love is true it transcends all social facades; the way they showed this, with a dude shaving another&#39; s scrotum and the million-times-mutilated-and-beaten-to-death-horse premature ejaculation routine (with obvious allusions to American Pie and Happiness - the latter in the disgusting scene denouement involving the family dog). I feel as if the movie was like adjoining ridiculous jokes into an unformed wretched ball of raw sewage. Goes to show marketing can push anything out there, shine whatever fetid mass and call it gold, people will come (worked for me). Done with tirade. ",2
"When I saw the trailer for She&#39; s Out of my League, I have to admit that I laughed, but I was thinking that if I had seen this movie, it would probably be a let down. One of those &quot; you saw the funny parts in the trailer&quot; movies. But still, I saw the movie just keeping my expectations low as most romantic comedies are just awful. Much to my pleasant surprise, She&#39; s Out of My League was a really funny movie that I enjoyed very much. In a society obsessed with looks and being perfect, most romantic comedies have these gorgeous people in the leads who don&#39; t look like they need any help in their love lives, we finally get a lead who isn&#39; t drop dead gorgeous as for Hollywood standards getting a beautiful person. Though I do wish we could have a romantic comedy with the opposite, not so hot girl gets the hot guy, I guess we&#39; ll have to wait a while for that. But She&#39; s Out of My League does deliver in the laughs and entertainment with great chemistry with our two leads and supporting cast. <br/><br/>Kirk is in his mid-20s who has a low self-esteem and, by his own admission, has not accomplished very much in life. He works at the Pittsburgh International Airport as a security officer and has very few goals other than trying to get back together with his self-centered ex-girlfriend Marnie. Marnie ended her relationship with Kirk two years ago and is highly dismissive of his continued romantic interests. However, she has remained close with Kirk&#39; s parents and overbearing brother and continues to participate in family activities along with her new boyfriend. With no relationship and an awkward family life, Kirk confides in his three close male friends who also work with him at the airport. Then at work one morning, a strikingly beautiful woman named Molly arrives at the passenger terminal for a flight to New York. She and Kirk exchange a few smiles and flirtatious words, and she then proceeds to her flight, accidentally leaving her iPhone in the airport security area. Upon realizing she has misplaced it, Molly calls her phone and Kirk, back at the security checkpoint, answers. To everyone&#39; s surprise Molly really likes Kirk, his friends constantly remind him he&#39; s a 5 and she&#39; s a 10, so he feels the pressure to keep her around. <br/><br/>What I liked most about this movie was how it wasn&#39; t a COMPLETE cliché, Molly&#39; s hot ex wants her back, but he doesn&#39; t go through outrageous attempts to get her back or anything, he&#39; s just as insecure as our leading male. It turns out that the only reason why Kirk is uncomfortable dating Molly is because he is reminded on a daily basis on how average he is and how he&#39; ll never get a gorgeous or sophisticated woman like Molly. A lot of people can relate to that, heck, how many times on the street do we see an unattractive looking person with someone who is really good looking and make a judgment? I loved how even his family were a bunch of jerks and not the typical &quot; we&#39; re rooting for our son&quot; mentality, they actually almost preferred his ex&#39; s new boyfriend over him, how sad is that? She&#39; s Out of My League is a big recommendation from me, definitely worth the rental when it comes out, it&#39; s one of the better romantic comedies that I&#39; ve seen. <br/><br/>7/10",7
"What is this? Am I stuck in a vortex of terrible movies or something? Or is it just that greedy men in business suits will feed the dumbed down population whatever crap they desire as the most of population will empty their wallets for it? <br/><br/>OK then, let me start reviewing this movie. Firstly, the starting itself told me that this movie was going to be something I&#39; ve watched a million times before. An overview of the city while a dumb song plays. How original. I&#39; m sure you&#39; ve read the plot if you&#39; re reading this review. A very good looking girl falls for a very average &#39; nice&#39; guy. There are many things that are wrong with this movie. Firstly, the music. It&#39; s really annoying to hear a radio friendly pop rock song in every other scene in a movie that&#39; s not even related to music. Secondly, the humour. If you&#39; ve watched any modern mainstream non romantic comedy you know what to expect here. It consists of swearing, more swearing and sexual innuendos. I do not find swearing at an elderly man who does not deserve to be sworn at funny. I don&#39; t see why anyone over the age of 13 would find premature ejaculation, which was supposed to be one of the funniest jokes of the movie, amusing at all. Showing middle fingers, pointless profanity, shaving pubic hair. . . I mean seriously? Do they really expect people to laugh at this? It&#39; s the same recycled bull we&#39; ve been seeing for a long long time, started by movies like &#39; Revenge Of the Nerds&#39; (These jokes sucked even then!)<br/><br/>Other than the worthless humour we have tons of pseudo drama involved here. Just before the ending there is the formulatic &#39; sad&#39; part, just like every other &#39; comedy&#39; movie nowadays. There is a dumb moral to be learnt at the end too. And apparently, all people are rated by numbers (from 1-10, or something) and everyone, and I mean everyone, knows about this rating system. The characters are people I really don&#39; t care about. And the ending, well it&#39; s your typical Hollywood &#39; everything&#39; s fine and peachy&#39; ending. <br/><br/>What can I say? There is nothing smart, witty, entertaining, original or redeemable about this movie. It&#39; s just another pile of crap Hollywood has put out and will keep putting until people stop watching (or at least paying). So please, for the love of decent cinema, do not pay for this or other generic movies so those evil greedy men in business suits can realize that enough is enough. ",2
"It would have been really easy to miss this movie. You tend to get a few different romantic comedies a year and most of them filter into static. Unless you&#39; re a really big fan of the genre, for me at least (romantic comedies are fine but they aren&#39; t my genre of choice) they go in one ear and out the other. Every so often one seems to stick (Morning Glory, About Last Night and Definitely Maybe would be my other picks from the last few years) and this was one of those movies for me. Some funny dialogue, characters that you can relate to and a genuinely sweet relationship go a long way and that&#39; s why I&#39; m coming back to review this movie <br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* We join Kirk (Jay Baruchel) as he&#39; s rehearsing a speech to try and convince his ex-girlfriend Marnie (Lindsay Sloane) to get back together with him. Instead of being supportive, his group of friends: Stainer (T. J. Miller), Mike Vogel (Jack) and Devon (Nate Torrence) take turns roasting him on why it&#39; s a terrible idea. They mock Kirk for being unattractive and try to tell him getting back together is a mistake. Kirk&#39; s lonely since their breakup however and brushes his friends off as being resentful because they weren&#39; t big fans of Marnie<br/><br/>The movie flashes ahead to Kirk actually giving Marnie the speech and a crappy piece of jewellery. To Kirk&#39; s horror she not only turns him down but refuses to leave because she&#39; s grown attached to Kirk&#39; s family. She&#39; s got a new boyfriend who also hangs around Ron (Hayes MacArthur) and it turns out minus his mom (Debra Jo Rupp), his entire family are a bunch of jerks. <br/><br/>Kirk heads off to work at the airport as TSA and a beautiful woman walks in. Her name is Molly (Alice Eve) and everyone starts to stare when she passes by. Despite her friendly demeanour she gets some unwanted attention from Kirk&#39; s boss. Kirk helps her out and gets her on her way. Once she boards she realizes she left her phone back in security. Kirk answers her call from her friend&#39; s phone and she promises to meet up with him once she gets back from her trip. <br/><br/>If you read the plot summary, it seems pretty average. I would agree with that criticism but the characters pick up the slack. I found it easy to identify with Kirk, he&#39; s stuck in a dead end job and he wants more but he&#39; s just as confused as the audience when this beautiful woman pays attention to him. He&#39; s an average guy but he&#39; s also easy to root for. Molly is also a great character, you find out she has her own motivations for being interested in Kirk but she&#39; s impressive inside and out. She&#39; s cool and she&#39; s not shallow at all and she and Kirk are good for each other. The side characters like Stainer and Devon don&#39; t have much development but they&#39; re there more for the comedy than to add to the plot. I also think that the movie comes to a nice conclusion, sure it has the feel good aspect but they keep it funny and it achieves a good balance. She&#39; s Out of My League has a good message as well, it&#39; s nothing new but it has some relevance today about how the important thing is being self-confident and not underestimating your chances and who you are. <br/><br/>Most comedies rely a lot on ad-libbing but they can&#39; t hold up over the course of the movie. I found that this movie did excel in that area. Having some great comedians like Jay Baruchel and T. J. Miller pay off for the movie, the dialogue whether it was scripted or not was hilarious. Comedy is subjective and there is some stuff here that won&#39; t work for everyone (there&#39; s some gross out humour but they don&#39; t overdo it) but I&#39; ve seen this movie more than a few times and I laugh a lot every single viewing. <br/><br/>When I talk about the cast, I look back on this movie and I struggle to see why this movie didn&#39; t lead to bigger things for the bigger stars of She&#39; s Out of My League. T. J. Miller is on Silicon Valley and Krysten Ritter is the star of Jessica Jones and they&#39; re both pretty good here. I think this movie shows that Jay Baruchel can carry a comedy by himself. He&#39; s often hanging out with Seth Rogen and the gang (This is the End is a crazy funny comedy) but he does a solid job as the lead in this movie. I also think that Alice Eve shines here, much like Margot Robbie or Emma Stone she&#39; s gorgeous but she shows a lot of charisma and she&#39; s funny in certain scenes. She might not be on their level but there are shades of that here. I would have thought she&#39; d be grabbing higher profile projects but I can&#39; t imagine that most people would walk away with bad things to say after watching this movie. Lindsay Sloane is also a riot, she bounces off Baruchel and Miller really well and completely holds her own. <br/><br/>I would never claim that this movie is a landmark in cinema or that it reinvents the romantic comedy genre but for me it&#39; s a really funny movie with a sweet enough relationship at the centre of it. I like the characters, the jokes, the actors/actresses and it&#39; s held up pretty well after multiple viewings. I can&#39; t ask for much more than that and if you&#39; re in the mood for something like this, it&#39; s definitely worth a watch. ",9
"first of all, i am new to Hollywood&#39; s romantic comedy genre i have watched few movies of this genre then my friend suggested this movie. i have started to watch this movie with high expectations because of the cast. Alice eve the name is enough for me to watch the movie. she looked very hot from the start till the end. the major advantage of this movie is having her at the lead. jay baruchel is a pleasant surprise. i have not watched any of his movies before. but he did his part well. the cast major role in this movie, the friends and family of kirk did their part very well, especially kirk&#39; s brother Dylan was so comic and hilarious. the movie have so many funny and hilarious parts, all the parts were well and neatly executed. the dialogues are so intriguing and fresh. Overall a very good entertainer for Sunday evening enjoy the run my vote 8/10. . . ",8
"Admittedly, just tuning in to find this perfect 10 on the screen held my attention. And then listening to the weedy Kirk played by Jay Baruchel made me like him a lot. <br/><br/>Maybe my own experiences of having a perfect 10 (OK, 9+) made me want to see how the film ended, but there were some real laugh out loud moments too. <br/><br/>And, of course, you knew there had to be a happy ending - which there was in more ways than one. <br/><br/>Checking on IMDb to see what the rating was, I was surprised to see it was so low. I think at least 7. 5 or 8 is about right. At least you&#39; ll feel good after watching it. <br/><br/>So, enjoy this film. It is sweet and so is Alice Eve. Wow!",8
"She&#39; s Out Of My League is a slightly over the top romantic comedy with a big heart. <br/><br/>An hour into the film I looked at my watch! That however is a good thing because I didn&#39; t want it to end. Then 3/4 into it the inevitable happened, the obligatory boy loses girl. <br/><br/>So really it should be a solid 7 or 8/10. However instead of a tacked on ending, we get to enjoy a great finale which turns it right round. <br/><br/>The main characters are a rather weak looking and pathetically &#39; nice&#39; Jay Baruchel with a rather pretty and adorable Alice Eve. Supporting Jay are a motley crew of pals who try their best to remote control him and get the girl who is most definitely out of his league!<br/><br/>Supporting Alice is the straight talking Krysten Ritter, who doesn&#39; t have much to work with but sparkles. The same also applies to Nate Torrence who was great!<br/><br/>Jay and his crew work in airport security whilst Alice is a party planner who is frisked through by Jay. Chaos and order ensues!<br/><br/>Pros - Sweet, Funny, Rude, Bootlace<br/><br/>Cons - Too short!<br/><br/>Overall - 11 out of 10",10
"When &#39; She&#39; s Out of My League&#39; was released, I had never heard of it. In fact I only heard about it three years later when I saw the first 10 minutes on TV. After that 10 minutes, I was interested so I bought the DVD primarily because I dislike not seeing movie endings, and was very pleasantly surprised at the outcome. <br/><br/>I thought &#39; She&#39; s Out of My League&#39; was excellent. For a movie that has taken so many used ideas, it manages to blend everything together perfectly into a semi-crude but always cheerful romantic comedy about a regular Joe named Kirk and his struggles when he meets and dates Molly, a girl who is seemingly way higher up than he on almost every scale. <br/><br/>I think the main strength of this movie was the characters - prior to seeing it, I&#39; d never heard of any of them, nor seen any movies they&#39; d been in, and I was able to get into the story much better than had it been filled with Hollywood A-listers. The writing was sound, though the ideas were all very formulaic and horribly predictable, however in the end I found that it didn&#39; t matter anyway. The withdrawn and kind nature of Kirk, combined with the idiocy (and loyalty) of his mismatched group of friends meant that I couldn&#39; t help but love the transition Kirk made from bumbling loser to confident boyfriend of a woman likely to be the hottest girl in the city. <br/><br/>Some people seemed to have issues with the vulgar nature of some of the movie, though personally I didn&#39; t. I thought most scenes were very funny, and though swearing occurs here and there I thought that most of the comedic scenes were clever enough in construction that they didn&#39; t actively detract from the love story going on around them. <br/><br/>All in all I was very surprised after watching this movie. I expected that it might be another average romantic comedy that I&#39; d watch a couple of times and then it would wear off, but instead this movie is full of emotion and offers a lot of heart and feeling, something sorely missing in many other films. I&#39; ll also specially mention the soundtrack which I personally consider to be one of the best I&#39; ve heard to date (well, using songs that weren&#39; t made for the movie). Yes, the airport scene at the end is horribly cliché, but I can&#39; t help but smile every time I hear the opening guitar of Jet&#39; s &#39; Cold Hard B****&#39; as Molly goes chasing after Kirk. Great Stuff. ",8
"The movie goes past fast, make sure you have good volume controls and no distractions. The blonde star&#39; s parents in the movie are her parents in real life! The supporting cast comes through just great. The airport scenes are familiar with us all. Making fun of average guy who is liked by the gorgeous girl is a little different than when the guy almost always likes the girl he cannot have. The uncut version has a lot of foul language, the only downside I could find. I&#39; m watching on E television and the language is gone. . . . No special effects, just clever writing and skilled workers and actors. It made money for the investors. They should make more movies like this, a message like 60&#39; s television series always had. ",10
"This movie caught me completely off guard. I was expecting non-stop stupidity and it was not that at all. How many times have you seen a really hot woman with a kind of chumpy-looking dude? I&#39; ve seen a few. But to make a whole movie about that, well that is some really good creativity. <br/><br/>I loved the supporting cast. Great acting from them. As I said, all fresh faces. Maybe other people have seen these actors in other movies or TV shows. I know I&#39; ve seen the actress who plays the Mom on &quot; That 70s Show&quot; but that&#39; s about it. The beautiful young actresses in this movie were all great actors and very good looking on screen all the time. And they were funny. They played their parts really well. <br/><br/>The lead actress comes across as being like really out of that guy&#39; s league, but you start to look at her and say, yeah she&#39; s not so high up there to settle for the guy who works at the airport. <br/><br/>The situations that the main actor gets himself into were all hilarious and very believable. Good warm humor written through-out this film. Friggin&#39; funny! I did see this on video so it does have an R rating and that is for the really stupid parts that in my opinion were totally out of place for this movie. Like the creators didn&#39; t have enough confidence in their movie so they had to put in some dumb scenes that just were not funny. <br/><br/>But hey, those parts of the movie are not the whole movie. The rest of this really good movie is just non-stop hilarity. Worth a watch. I strongly recommend. Great soundtrack too. ",8
"She&#39; s out of My League is the type of film that seems to suffer from a crisis of identity; is it a romantic comedy or an Apatow-esquire combination of raunch and insight? Jay Baruchel&#39; s first starring vehicle tries to have its cake and have sex with it too, and winds up splitting its resources to less effective result. <br/><br/>Frankly put, She&#39; s out of My League is not funny. There is the scattered chuckle and a few moments worthy of a laugh but for the most part the narrative just hums along; never becoming outwardly awful nor achieving anything memorable. The films saving grace is the chemistry between Jay Baruchel and Alice Eve which at times is so strong it almost makes the movie worth seeing in spite of itself. If SooML had concentrated on the romantic efforts, I feel like something excellent could have sprung forth, but with its scattershot approach we have only the leads on which to lean. <br/><br/>Perhaps the most refreshing thing about League is that Eve&#39; s Molly is actually a nice person. She is not manipulative, hot-but bitchy or using our nerdy hero for her own purposes. Usually in a movie like this we have the girl-best friend who unbeknownst to our swooning protagonist holds a flame, and after the hottie eventually betrays him, he finds love has been beside him all along, etc, etc. We don&#39; t have this here; there are now competing forces for Kirk&#39; s affections and the film and the audience win because of it. <br/><br/>There is a lame ongoing gag where our leads are rated; Kirk is a &#39; 5&#39; and whatever number you receive, the laws of nature inhibit you from deviating more than 2 &#39; points&#39; in either direction. Enter Molly, a hard &#39; 10&#39; and after leaving her cell phone at the airport where our geeky Romeo is employed she becomes somewhat smitten (feelings which he immediately returns) to the astonishment of his friends who can&#39; t believe his luck. From there we get our normal rom-com story arch which as I stated is heavily bolstered by amazing chemistry and performances from the star-crossed lovers. <br/><br/>Also like many movies of this ilk, the friends of the leads are jerks/bitches who more than once, accidentally or intentionally pull Kirk and Molly apart. I don&#39; t understand this resurfacing convention but it grows more distasteful with every film. Thankfully some of these characters undergo an epiphany so they do not remain totally repulsive characters. She&#39; s out of My League is unimposing and sweet, and is not above a watch on a date night or rainy Sunday but it certainly nothing to rush out to see in theatres. <br/><br/>Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies. blogspot. com",6
"I felt self conscious and embarrassed somehow. Is this the model woman we should be inspired by? Oh my God! She&#39; s like a bad replica of a mediocre man. She abandons her husband and he&#39; s the one, quite rightly, who feels betrayed. She uses James Franco and then throws him away. Keeps Richard Jenkins at arms length until she discovers he has something that may be useful to her and then, Javier Bardem. . . She shouts at him I don&#39; t have to love you to love myself. What? She reeks of an awful case of selfishness but as she is played by Julia Roberts the whole thing becomes rather confusing. Is she a modern heroine? Oh God, I hope that wasn&#39; t the intention. I felt as far away from her even further away from the character she played in &quot; My Best Friend&#39; s Wedding&quot; Remember that one? In that one she becomes a criminal, really, yes, a criminal, to ruin her friend&#39; s wedding. Oblivious to the fact that&#39; s he&#39; s clearly happy with Cameron Diaz. No, she&#39; s only worried about herself. I&#39; m giving &quot; Eat Pray Love&quot; a 3 and not a 1 because some landscapes, geographic as well as culinary are, quite simply, breath taking. Also Javier Bardem is worth the price of the very expensive ticket. ",3
". . . or everybody loves Julia. Free-thinking, never-been-to-me writer Liz, (Julia Roberts) decides to escape the rat race and her well-meaning but smothering husband to, of course, find her true self by travelling to Italy, India and Bali, as you would and experiencing real life in the process. We all should have her problems. <br/><br/>And yes, by the end, she&#39; s made umpteen life-long friendships, found her own guru and the power of zen, built a new home for a single-parent and child from contributions solicited from the afore-mentioned new pals and of course to top it all off, finds true love way out east to a handsome, swarthy Brazilian, who openly discusses his sex-life with his 19 year-old Australian (don&#39; t ask me why) son whom he kisses on the lips at goodbyes. Along the way she breaks the hearts of two young handsome guys, turns down another and connects seriously with everyone from a Swedish tourist and her tutor in Italy, a recovering Texan alcoholic and teenage girl going through an arranged marriage in India not forgetting her Latin lover, toothless ancient swami and his homeless nurse in Bali. Yes indeed, love surely grows where Lizzie goes. <br/><br/>The writing and acting are frequently look-away bad, the whole thing looking like a woman&#39; s magazine piece bloated out of all recognition. For some reason too, 70&#39; s music features heavily in the soundtrack - I just wondered what Neil Young might have made of two of his songs being pressed into action in support of this unbelievable, over-sentimental nonsense. <br/><br/>I can think of only one praiseworthy thing to say about this film. . . er, nice locations. ",1
"I loved the book. I thought Julia Roberts as Liz was fantastic casting. The trailer looked awesome. I smiled every time I saw it. Turns out, I loved everything about this movie except the movie. <br/><br/>Long story short, it&#39; s all of the arc of the book, without any of the passion. While never horrible, this film simply made me feel nothing. <br/><br/>I found the book soulful, moving, even transformative at times. The greatest emotion I felt from the film was hunger (for Italian pizza), thirst (for Italian wine), and an occasional dizziness due to director Ryan Murphy&#39; s apparent recent discovery of how to &quot; pan. &quot; It was laughable camera-work throughout the first 45 minutes, and occasionally throughout. <br/><br/>The first 1/2 hour of the film was almost unbearably bad, even though the first section of the book was amongst my favorites. Perhaps someone who did not read the book could enjoy this movie, but I somehow doubt it. One time Liz made a joke, that was a nice break from the feeling of being in a lukewarm bathtub for 2 1/2 hours. Not unpleasant, just meh. <br/><br/>Instead of finding Liz intelligent and thoughtful, she seemed selfish, boring, and obsessed with men. Instead of finding spirituality, she seemed vapid. When the character becomes shallow, a film centered around that character becomes a throw away. Maybe I&#39; ll just watch the trailer again. ",4
"I did read the book but, I had hoped that this was going to be like &quot; The Bridges Of Madison County&quot; . The film so much better than the book thanks to Meryl Streep&#39; s Francesca, a woman I could follow and learn from in every way. Here, my hero, Julia Roberts is as static as the page that originated her character. I couldn&#39; t and wouldn&#39; t get interested in her. Women, no matter how independent, remain nurturers by nature. I was desolate. I sided with her husband, Billy Crudup, totally. And what about the younger guy, James Franco, she takes instead of giving and she also takes from Richard Jenkins and Javier Bardem in Bali. It is in fact in Bali where I detected a glimpse of real emotion an emotion provoked by somebody else&#39; s feelings. I could see a film about that woman. Julia feels detached, as if she was just going through the motions. I&#39; m sorry critics and public ganged up against her for her work in &quot; Mery Reilly&quot; An actress of Julia&#39; s talent and beauty could have contributed a sensational gallery of different women. Instead she seems stacked in this shrill, angry lady with very little to say. ",3
"&quot; Eat, Pray, Love&quot; is about a wealthy, over-privileged woman who has a mid-life crises and instead of buying a sports car, she divorces her husband, has some affairs, and spends a boat-load of money. <br/><br/>I guess the moral of the story is that money can buy happiness. <br/><br/>This is the type of movie that makes people want to join the &quot; occupy&quot; movement. The whole point of the movie is that over-indulging is the way to find yourself and be happy. <br/><br/>And just to pour salt in the wound, in the scene where she is eating pasta in Italy is done to the music of Mozart&#39; s German opera &quot; The Magic Flute. &quot; I guess nobody associated with this piece of trash was smart enough to tell the difference between Italian and German. <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and skip this garbage. ",1
"I love travelogues and I&#39; m a fan of Julia Roberts but, what happened here? I&#39; m not sure in what period, time wise, it this set. The only turmoil seems to be in this very selfish forty-something. What about the rest of the world? She goes for a sort of journey of discovery in a world that doesn&#39; t really exist. Did I miss something? No wars, no economic crisis, no nothing, only the intimate qualm of a woman who I, personally, cannot feel represented by. I grant you I&#39; m from another generation but, please! What is this. I loved the food and Javier Bardem and it is in fact the Bardem episode that brings some kind of recognizable something to the proceedings. So, let me recapitulate and ask you if we&#39; ve seen the same movie. . . A woman facing an existential crisis and moves out from her marital abode without even having a discussion about it with her husband - a scrumptious Billy Crudup - then she has an affair with James Franco - who wouldn&#39; t, right? - but the Franco in this movie is just a plain reflection of the Franco from &quot; Milk&quot; just to name one title. The Naples presented here seems out of the mind of someone who&#39; s never been to Naples. I don&#39; t know what to say. I&#39; m a bit puzzled and, I should confess, a bit annoyed. ",4
"Never read the book and thanks to this well-produced wretched film never will. The IMDb synopsis is inaccurate. . . you get no sense this broad is trying to have a kid or that her marriage has been failing. She one day decides she doesn&#39; t want it anymore and, props to the acting of Crudup, the husband has no reason to know why. Her subsequent lover is left with the same &quot; huh?&quot; moment. It&#39; s as if she needs to punish anyone who treats her well. <br/><br/>Only good looking men fall in love with Liz, and everyone admires her. She dumps her lovers and husband and the only friend that will tell her what she needs to hear, in the belief that &quot; balance&quot; lies so far outside herself that she has to travel the world (on a very tight schedule) to seek enlightenment. How she pays for it is never hinted at. And to have this bone-thin creature lecture another bone-thin creature on the need to &quot; just enjoy eating, we can always buy a bigger pair of jeans&quot; is insulting AND laughable. That the scene is followed by two bone-thin actresses faking attempts to &quot; squeeze into&quot; jeans is just insulting. <br/><br/>And the punch line? The woman who has wasted 2. 5 hours of your life whining that everyone around her says she needs a man finally finds &quot; balance&quot; . . . by finding a man. And FYI EVERY man in this film is sensitive and caring. I have to say that the direction and very good supportive acting presents an effective image of all sorts of energetic life going on around Liz (and inviting her to be part of it) while she sits whining to herself in voice-over. But the unreality of EVERYONE LOVING HER is just a bit lame. <br/><br/>Fiction? Not much. <br/><br/>Oh, and why did I spend money to see this? A friend convinced me it would be great, and she is such a good friend and enjoyed it so much I will never tell her exactly how much I despised it. See? For people you care about sometimes you hold yourself back. <br/><br/>FYI Richard Jenkins is the only person Julia Roberts&#39; Liz really connects to. . . and even that is ruined by a last-minute &quot; Hollywood&quot; moment. No spoiler here, you&#39; ll see it lumbering toward you like an elephant in the desert. ",1
"But this is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. However, there are some (very small) silver linings. <br/><br/>For instance, with Julia Roberts, Richard Jenkins, Billy Crudup, James Franco, and Javier Bardem, I had high expectations. I award one half star for each actor, and round up out of kindness. <br/><br/>But then. . . the movie started, and the most agonizing 2+ hours of my life ensued. <br/><br/>First, some background information. I went to see Eat Pray Love for my dear mother and free popcorn. She asked me earlier today, and I, being the loving son, agreed to accompany her. <br/><br/>Within ten minutes I had realized what a disastrous mistake I had made. I am an empathetic person, and I had no idea it was possible for a film to give me have no feelings whatsoever for protagonist. <br/><br/>That is not true, at times I wanted her to be hit by a train. I have never left a movie that I had paid for, but eventually my mother and I were plotting ways to escape. We settled on screaming &quot; Mouse!&quot; or &quot; Rodent!&quot; or &quot; Fire!&quot; but decided it was not worth the social awkwardness. <br/><br/>Instead we sat through, as I said, the most agonizing 2+ hours of film, ever. A summary ensues. . . <br/><br/>Whine-Whine-Divorce-Whine-Cry-Travel-Whine-Eat-Whine-Feminist Bullshit-Whine-Elevate Importance-Whine-Whine-Travel-Whine-Attempt Meditation-Whine-Get Better at Meditation with help of Hippie-Whine-Elevate Importance to Unknown Levels-Whine-Whine-Travel-Whine-Whine-&quot; Fall in Love&quot; I think that is pretty much it. Do not see this film. ",3
"I didn&#39; t read Elizabeth Gilbert&#39; s autobiographical book on which this movie is based (and I&#39; m not sure I want to after viewing this movie, although I&#39; m sure the book is wittier and more inspiring), but even reading the New York Times book review I can see that the movie missed the boat. As such, Julia Roberts plays a character who takes the prize for being a world class narcissist. A more self-centered heroine would be hard to find. After asking her heartbroken husband, played by Billy Crudup, for a divorce because she is not happy and needs to find herself, she jumps into an affair a struggling actor, whom she leaves as soon as her divorce becomes final and she is free to travel to Italy, India and Bali, to spend a year trying to sort out her id. I do not recall the movie making clear how she can financially afford to do so (she forfeits everything to her husband in exchange for the divorce), but elsewhere I read that Ms. Gilbert obtained an advance from her publisher to write a book based on her experiences eating, praying and loving for the year. <br/><br/>In the movie, Liz eats her way through Italy, struggles with meditation in India -- where she meets the most obnoxious, arrogant fellow traveler, played by Richard Jenkins, who browbeats her until she learns to cherish him as a friend -- then moves on to Bali where she falls in love and literally sails off into the sunset with him. <br/><br/>Throughout this tedious film, Liz&#39; s actions seem to reflect the influence of the person or persons with whom she has been with most recently; she doesn&#39; t seem to have a mind of her own, or heart, for that matter. The only spark of humanity that we see in Liz is when she emails her friends asking them to pass on getting her a birthday present and instead send month to help a divorced woman in Bali to afford a house for her and her young daughter; apparently divorced women in Bali have a rank slightly higher than dogs (nice place). <br/><br/>I&#39; ve experienced the charms of Italy--its wonderful scenery and food, and somewhat insane men--and don&#39; t need this movie to entice me; however, I might be put off India and Bali as a result of seeing this movie. One could argue that it is always a pleasure to watch Julia Roberts, Javier Bardem and Billy Crudup, who blessedly all played themselves and not their miserable characters, none of which I would ever want to meet. <br/><br/>Is there a woman -- or man -- who would not love to chuck it all for a year and travel the globe in search of self-discovery? Most of us cannot do this because we have responsibilities and loyalties and are not financially independent. This drab story fails to connect on any level except for pointless self-indulgence. Instead, treat yourself to dinner at a nice Italian restaurant, dab on a little Shalimar and watch Gone With The Wind, a truly romantic epic with a narcissistic heroine who is interesting. ",1
"This film has nothing going for it. - Cardboard characters, puerile story, cheesy dialog. Did the characters draw me in - no - I didn&#39; t care what happened to the characters and I would have walked out except I was with friends. I got sick of close ups of Julia Roberts trying to act, and the predictable and clichéd script. I looked at my watching twice during the film - something that I can not recall doing before. The scene with the women buying a bigger size jeans was laughable, as there was absolutely no difference in their appearance and they were still very slim. The man that she met in the Ashram&#39; s story was acted out in such a dreadful way. It is such a skill to create emotion in movie-goers, and no way was this achieved. ",1
"Who writes these types of stories, and why does Hollywood have to keep churning out these types of movies? Successful woman with a husband who loves her isn&#39; t happy with her life because she has some sort of neurosis and feels &quot; trapped. &quot; So we all get treated to 400 pages or 2. 5 hours of BS while said woman goes and &quot; finds herself. &quot; And we are all supposed to believe that this is all just hunky dory? And we&#39; re supposed to excuse the fact that she is acting selfish by tearing apart people&#39; s lives (mostly the aforementioned loving husband) because she has go on this &quot; liberating&quot; journey of self-discovery where &quot; she doesn&#39; t have to love the man to love herself?&quot; I&#39; m sorry, I&#39; m calling BS on this. If the main character of this story were male, women&#39; s groups would be screaming, protests would be taking place, and the movie would be the punching bag subject of every talk show from Oprah to The View. <br/><br/>A message for anyone (but particularly women) that sees themselves in Julia Roberts character: Get some much needed and overdue professional help with your problem. You have a deep psychological disorder and it is NOT OK to make people miserable because of it. ",1
"There are so many things fundamentally wrong with this movie as well as with many details. Most have already been mentioned before me so I&#39; ll just rage a bit. 1, uses double standards, to say the least: if you are white and rich - &quot; go out in the world to discover yourself&quot; / if you are brown and poor: go for the arranged marriage no matter how much you&#39; d love to study and find love. 2, even though the movie tries to be a feminist statement what we see is that a woman is nothing without a man and finding yourself EQUALS to finding a man 3, the shallow, stupid, irresponsible protagonist seems to be shown as a HEROINE (!) - an example to follow 4, &quot; You&#39; ll lose all your money in 6-10 months&quot; - eating gourmet food in Rome, not working for a couple months and traveling to 2 new continents? Well, well, well. . . 5, Rome, Italy is NOT a 3rd world country with no running/hot water. Though I lived in Italy I never heard anyone speaking the kind of English you hear in the movie (great English with extremely heavy accent). 6, There already are so many shallow and dumb people: why do you try to cater for them a shallow and dumb story (okay, other than because you earn well with it)? 7, Leaving an unhappy marriage, traveling to discover the world and living in new environments is a very brave thing. However: - not consulting with your husband and not having any communication about a divorce; - discovering the world means to you that you meet Americans who are just like you in India; - going to random places where you seemingly spend a lot and all you get to know is things you could understand from an &quot; Italian / Indian / Balinese Stereotypes&quot; paperback - this makes you shallow and below average. 8, Julia is completely indecisive. The one decision she makes throughout the movie is to keep up her schedule and balanced life. The Balinese medicine man convinces her with one sentence that she decided the wrong way. So she changes her mind immediately: puppet, Puppet, PUPPET! 9, Since Pocahontas we know that not all Hollywood movies need to have a 100% pinky-shiny-happy ending. Maybe Julia doesn&#39; t know it. <br/><br/>There are good things in the movie though: - you get hungry for a good pizza &amp; fresh pasta - landscape shots, travel suggestions (Italy, India, Bali) - you&#39; ll probably feel superior to 95% the characters shown in the movie while utterly superior to the people that like this movie <br/><br/>This is one of the very few movies that made me angry lately.

"Julia Roberts plays the soulless and selfish character, Liz, as she goes searching for herself in Italy, India, and Bali. This forty something married New Yorker decides to end her marriage since she is bored because that is what you do. Did the man cheat? No. Was he unfaithful? No. Was he unloving? No. Did he abuse her? No. Was he lazy? No. His crime? He was predictable and waited for her. Well, let&#39; s walk and act like a 2 year old. Julia Roberts makes no connection with the audience and the film slides into boring and uninspiring mess as she trudges her way to self discovery. The character, Liz, is narcissistic to the point of parody. She immediately takes up with a brooding young actor, and, predictably, leaves that relationship to search for happiness. Her best friend wishes she can go with her on hew adventure - too bad since Viola Davis&#39; character is so under utilized in this film. Liz goes to Italy, eats her way across the boot never gaining an ounce, quickly finds new friends, celebrates a glorious Thanksgiving with a bunch of strangers and claims she is the luckiest girl alive. The only &quot; real&quot; moment in this film is a young girl giving Julia the middle finger from a balcony. It has a lingering moment that rings true. She goes to India, washes floors on her hands and knees which making her actions so unbelievable that an urbane Manhattanite like herself would suffer the indignities of menial labor. By the time she goes to Bali, I checked out of this disaster of a film. Even the scenery can&#39; t save this atrocity. The movie is wretched to watch. You may enjoy it if you want to see an egotistical character goes around sulking, whining, and moping about the meaning of life. Liz has been gives so much: a home, husband, job, friends, health, a few bucks and still she is not happy. Ingrates like her character are what is so wrong in this world. They have been blessed and have no appreciation for the many good things bestowed on them. So many suffer and would be grateful to have 1% of what this POS has been given and would be eternally happy. Julia Roberts is utterly charmless and taken her American Sweetheart and turned her into a overbearing shrew. ",1
"When I read the book last year, I had just lost my job, was looking for a new one and eating everything that was bad for me, so I enjoyed Liz&#39; s misery and newfound joys. But now that I&#39; m content, in this new phase of life, I find myself annoyed by people who create their own drama and then whine about it. So I would not have enjoyed the book if I were to read it now. Although everyone does a good job in this film, and the scenery is breathtaking -- now I want to go to Rome!!!-- I really couldn&#39; t stand Liz. She has everything but whines about how &quot; I don&#39; t even know how to be HERE!&quot; I meet people in my new job who are fighting cancer every day -- they deserve the opportunity to whine (and few do, I might add). But pretty people who have everything and think they deserve more just tick me off. And it was a long painful sit. I do love the men in this movie -- each one of them is so good. And Julia Roberts does what she can with this selfish character. I just don&#39; t want to spend any more time with spoiled Liz. The time I spent watching her only ticked me off. I cannot recommend it, unless you&#39; re self centered, indulged and rich -- this could be your inspiration. Phoo!",4
"Since I haven&#39; t touched the book, so I can&#39; t make that comparison. I walked in the movie thinking this lady&#39; s going to find herself through her travels and somehow inspire millions of us. <br/><br/>It turns out that the movie is about a smart, successful, somewhat good-looking author who has a very loving husband, am amazing job that lets her travel the world - and is still confused about her life and what she wants. <br/><br/>I thought there was going to be some tragedy or something that makes her want to leave her life. . but nope. . she&#39; s just been looking for a way out the whole time and putting the responsibility on a medicine man&#39; s palm reading, she leaves her husband, and her life. <br/><br/>As we travel with her, we realize that she&#39; s not really taking in what each of these places have to offer (except maybe for the language and non-verbal communication in Italy). The only thing we saw in India was the traffic and the arranged marriage of a minor. And Bali was more of a tourist departments commercial. <br/><br/>Essentially she was a superfluous tourist who just went to three different places without really making any kind of real journey. <br/><br/>The ending is formulaic with no deep meaning. The pace of the movie was very slow. Slow pace can be very good, if it makes the audience think or empathize. In this case, it didn&#39; t manage to do either. <br/><br/>I really wanted to walk out of this one. And now I&#39; m curious why the book was so popular?",2
"Two moments have stayed with me, one in particular: Javier Bardem crying as he says goodbye to his 19 year old son. The moment provokes a reaction on Julia Roberts&#39; s character that makes her totally human. The moment comes on the last third of the film so I thought it was a bit too late to start my relationship with her. The other moment happens at the beginning after she decides to walk away from her marriage and realizes she has broken her husband&#39; s heart. Terrific Billy Crudup fighting back tears as the elevator door closes. I love Julia Roberts but I can&#39; t quite buy her &quot; philosophical face&quot; 42 years of age in the new millennium is far too young for that kind of crisis, specially when the crisis is provoked by something missing in her. So, okay, a journey of discovery, but then. . . ? The discovery is that she knew it all along. What next. I must say the guys in the movie get the prize, third price really. The first price goes to the location, second price to the food - goodness, the food! - and third to the guys. Bardem fantastic, Richard Jenkins superb - Billy Crudup surprisingly real, James Franco also great and Luca Argentero another plus. ",7
"The only way to make a movie with an unlikeable, selfish, self-absorbed protagonist worse is to make it WAY too long. That is what we have here, folks. This movie is a monument to both feminist narcissism and boredom. Robert&#39; s character whines and complains about a life that most people would love to trade places with. The direction was surprisingly sub-par, as was the acting. Overweight lonely secretaries that have read the book MAY make it through to the end, but everyone else will either be in deep REM or left the theater. Nice scenery for a bicycle ride does not a great movie make. Not kidding, the storyline here is so bad that it makes &quot; Showgirls&quot; look like &quot; L. A. Confidential. &quot; This is not even worth a Redbox buck. ",1
"This movie it&#39; s about a journey in your life. Many people doesn&#39; t understand this message that movie reveal. Traveling it&#39; s discovering peace and wisdom to settle down your soul and life. Most of the people they live to achieve, not to feel. This movie it&#39; s about FEELING and discovering your life. <br/><br/>Julia she&#39; s a great actor. Bali it&#39; s a wonder island. . . just beautiful. ",10
"Just like Sex in the City, this film glorifies female borderline personality disorder. This film highlights fundamental flaws and defects in a woman&#39; s character and frames them as character assets. The film starts out with a pampered princess who has a loving and decently handsome husband who falls over himself for his wife (Julia) yet she is discontent due to major character flaws which are likely attributable to selfishness, self-centeredness and arrogance so she she decided to go &quot; find&quot; herself with foreign lovers while eating Italian food. <br/><br/>If this movie&#39; s main protagonist were a male, oh my God, could you imagine the female response? A male leaves his adoring, attractive wife to go bang foreign chicks while eating food? He would be considered a complete pig and further considered to be worth killing. These romcoms are now depicting women as these spoiled, privileged brats who are entitled to leave everybody else miserable while they &quot; find themselves&quot; . And the people they destroy both mentally and emotionally still &quot; understand&quot; that their torturer is just finding herself. These movies continue to portray hurtful and harmful behavior as a &quot; spiritual awakening&quot; . Julia Roberts plays the role of a spoiled, arrogant brat who is full of herself. After her jaunt to India maybe she wants to go join the other vapid female crew over in Dubai for a walk in the desert with no water. <br/><br/>In typical romcom fashion we have the arrogant female who leaves a trail of emotional wreckage in her wake (which we&#39; re supposed to discount completely as a sacrifice to the greater good of the female) while she searches the world for hippies, food and lovers. We have these sorry sack men who continue to tell her how great and special she is although she is the complete opposite of these things. We have arrogance and selfishness put on display and covered with a false veil of gold. This woman should be in court losing 1/2 of all her earnings to her husband whom she left to go whore about for no good reason. This woman should be the scourge of the Earth and should receive social contempt for her behavior. However, like most romcoms the female can hurt everyone she knows if it will aid her superficial quest for some kind of make believe fulfillment and then, like Stockholm Syndrome, all her victims will forgive her or tell her she is the most important thing in the world and her happiness comes before anybody or anything else. I can&#39; t believe men are still depicted as the heartless characters in films when every romcom depicts evil as good. <br/><br/>This movie made me cringe. I was forced to see it with mom, sister and wife. I told them all that the film literally made me sick. They agreed. This sort of behavior that is being engendered into women is sickening. Women who believe such a film represents anything positive about anything need to have their head checked for borderline personality disorder. Men need to stop treating women like little precious pieces of glass when those same women are not pieces of glass, are not these cute little powerless creatures but are instead, like Liz in the movie, arrogant, snotty, pampered, privileged, rude, morally bankrupt, conniving, selfish dolts who believe that their superficial happiness is worth any emotional cost to other people.

"Wow. I&#39; ve always admired Julia Roberts, and was wondering how she would transition to a more mature actress. Not well. Why in the world would she have read this abomination of a script, and said, &quot; Yes, I want to do that movie!&quot; ? And the other fine actors must have agreed because Roberts signed on. All the talent in this film can&#39; t correct the atrocious script. The film has four chapters, each of which introduces a new male character in a different part of the world, and charts her dysfunctional response to each. It&#39; s impossible, I suspect, to have developed each character and story all in a two hour movie. It was so hollow, not only did I feel nothing for the characters (except Bardem), but I felt ambivalence toward them. Lots of narcissistic angst over nothing. The movie had nothing to say. <br/><br/>I want my money back. More important, I want my two hours back. ",1
"it&#39; s that simple, this movie is just an insult for women(more or less intelligent), which i presume is the target audience. for the guys is, well, how should i put it gently, a neverending nightmare of whining, crying, feminist craptalk/attitude, some Italian recipies and goofy love postlude. oh, did i mention selfishness as the main trait of the heroine? in the so called journey she takes to &quot; rediscover&quot; herself, she does nothing more than showing her immense selfish nature fueled by inexplicable feminist outbursts, considering the men around her not only did never abuse her but were(strangely enough)fascinated by her. avoid, time and money are better spent even if watching a &quot; b&quot; minus zombie movie.

"When I first heard that Elizabeth Gilbert&#39; s book, Eat Pray Love, was being adapted for film, the first thought that ran in my mind was, &quot; How could that book be made into a movie?&quot; The book seemed too big for a single movie. I thought, perhaps a mini-series could encapsulate all that is required to fully tell the whole tale, but not a single movie. Also, for me, the most interesting parts of the book are Elizabeth&#39; s honestly-raw yet oft-humorous introspections and thoughts and I just couldn&#39; t imagine how thoughts could translate well on film without producing one hell of a dull movie. <br/><br/>When I found out Julia Roberts was cast as the main character of Elizabeth, my interest was piqued, so, I looked forward to seeing the movie despite my initial hesitation. <br/><br/>Eat Pray Love opens this Friday but I had the chance to view the film early at a screening tonight. As I had feared, Ryan Murphy&#39; s film adaption of the book is flawed, at best. The short synopsis of my review before I give away spoilers is: You should not see this movie if you do not L-O-V-E Julia Roberts or if you have not read the book. As to the former, Julia is the only saving grace in this extremely prolonged movie--her natural charisma and charm are the only reasons I don&#39; t say run and run fast away from this movie. But even she cannot make this movie good given its many flaws. As to the latter, if you have not read the book, you just won&#39; t get what happens in the US, Italy and India. You all will probably enjoy the scenes in Bali, but then again, that doesn&#39; t justify seeing the movie in its entirety. <br/><br/>(Spoilers ahead. ) The parts of the book which made the reader relate to Elizabeth on any level are entirely absent on film. Gone is any explanation of the breakdown of the marriage between Elizabeth and her husband, Stephen (played by Billy Crudup) or the prolonged struggle Elizabeth experienced before abandoning her marriage. There is no mention of the fact that Stephen wanted to start a family and Elizabeth&#39; s repulsion of the idea. There is no talk of both partners having witnessed the breakdown of Elizabeth into a &quot; madwoman&quot; or that they had been &quot; fighting and crying&quot; or that they had &quot; the eyes of refugees. &quot; They are simply shown as a normal couple, living the high life in NYC until Elizabeth decided to leave Stephen. <br/><br/>Also painfully absent is any intensity, addiction, passion or heartache experienced with her boyfriend, David (played by James Franco). If you see the movie without having read the book, you will not understand why Elizabeth leaves this relationship either. She just looks like a shallow, pleasure-seeking, escapist. <br/><br/>Other major themes of the book are entirely stricken. You are never told that Elizabeth got an advance for her book and that is how she paid for the year-long trip or that she practiced celibacy on purpose on her trip to self-discovery. Like the major events in the States, the ones in Italy and India are equally rushed and glossed over. What&#39; s worse is that the movie lacked spirituality which is the underlying theme of the book. <br/><br/>At this point, I am running out of steam of how else to convince you that this movie is not very good - I think this movie sucked my energy. So, I will leave you with: See it if you love Julia or have read the book. Otherwise, go see something else. --Parisa Michelle, author, CelebMagnet. com",3
"Firstly, I have never written a review about a movie BUT having read through the comments that most of you have left about this movie I just had to. Firstly, why did you bother going to see a movie like this if you are going to completely criticise everything about it; the whole point of the story is ONE PERSON&#39; S life and the personal decisions that someone has to make?!?!?!? Do you not think we hear enough about &#39; war, famine, rape, murder&#39; in our daily life/news. This movie is/and was never going to be about that – surely title gave it away &#39; EAT PRAY LOVE&#39; NOT &#39; FAMINE, CLIMATE CHANGE, MURDER&#39; EPL is a movie about the most intimate thoughts and feelings a of a modern woman who is caught up in a life she does not want and how she develops and changes herself/her life for the benefit herself and others around her – and to most of you that&#39; s a selfish thing to do?!?!?! REALLY!!!! I thought that EPL was brilliant. Your comments &#39; she is selfish&#39; , &#39; what planet is she from&#39; . . . just because Liz was living a life that society &#39; thinks&#39; we should be living, (married to a lovely man, beautiful home) does not mean she will be happy doing it does it?! AT LEAST she was a decent and strong person and didn&#39; t cheat on her husband (which so many do) or rely on happy pills or alcohol to get herself through the day (which many people do). She took herself away from her life and tried to reconnect with what she wants in life. And I&#39; m also guessing that NONE OF YOU have actually meditated, or spent time in an ashram or been &#39; silent&#39; for any length of time?! I recommend you do it and then watch the movie again. Regular meditation, being silent for a length of time and all of those other so called &#39; hippy&#39; things that she does are extremely enlightening and truly magical thing is, not everyone can handle it it&#39; s not easy taking a good hard look at yourself. The other interesting thing is that regardless of whether you&#39; re happy or unhappy in your current life, the things that Liz incorporates into her life are extremely beneficial and if we all spent time doing those things, life would see much brighter, simpler and happier place. I feel slightly sorry for those that cannot see the simple beauty in this TRUE STORY that was originally meant to be a kind of &#39; self help&#39; book that things happen for a reason and that people come and go in our life (male, female, young and old) and that you need to be true to yourself to be truly happy in your own skin.

"If you&#39; ve kept up with my reviews (lets pretend you have), you are going to find that the genre I touch most seldom is the romantic comedy. They are by nature a contagious quagmire of failed puns, roads repaved with familiar plots, and their stars have signed with the devil. Enter Julia Roberts, queen of the romcom. No doubt a talented actress, if not the most famous of her generation, Julia has played a big role in cashing in on the average woman&#39; s dream. <br/><br/>In her latest effort Julia plays Liz Gilbert in the autobiographical book turned movie Eat Pray Love. Liz is a writer visiting Bali in search of a wise/toothless medicine man. He reads the palm of her hand and she takes everything to gospel. Leaving behind husband Stephen (Billy Crudup), Liz seeks out new adventure in the form of exotic cuisine, Eastern religion, and male suitors. <br/><br/>Eat Pray Love is directed by Ryan Murphy. Murphy is best known as the creator of Glee, last year&#39; s breakout TV show about misfits who triumph through song. With his name in the mix people are going to be disappointed that Julia and friends don&#39; t break out into song and dance. Even if you consider that Murphy could have interests outside of musicals, you&#39; d expect some sassy dialog exchanges like those seen on the show between the characters Will Schuester and Sue Sylvester. Hate to disappoint you but that&#39; s not going to happen either. <br/><br/>Julia Roberts is a darling despite the degrading material and I&#39; m sure the draw of her chowing down will appeal to the target demographic until they realize that phase is left behind once Liz leaves Italy. If this were the story of a woman looking for the best things in life, I wouldn&#39; t take as much issue as I do. See, that&#39; s how one half of the population would view the plot. I see it more along the lines of a typical entry in the long catalog of films where the female lead has no idea what she&#39; s looking for in her life so she does whatever is irrational and fun because that&#39; s how movie magic works. Liz throws out a man who has given the viewer no reason for dismissal, but this is standard procedure in a chick flick because here woman can do anything and their lives will always improve. I&#39; ve encountered far too many girls who take these plots to heart and implement them in the real world, leaving a trail of confused men in their wake. I&#39; m a guy, and I&#39; m not dumb enough to think that all the explosions I see in the films designed for my gender need to be realized at home. <br/><br/>What Eat Pray Love has going for it is a borderline competency that lifts it slightly above film festival rejects. Actually the presence of A-list talent and obvious travel expenses add more to the production value than any cinematic technique on display. Many scenes are littered with mishandled lights, resulting in a glaucoma simulation that gave me a headache. It&#39; s even a tossup as to whether or not to anoint the audio as clear since half of Javier Bardem&#39; s dialog would be read as inaudible should one rent the Blu-ray down the road and turn on subtitles. Speaking of Bardem, his character&#39; s late appearance goes against every screen writing rule. In fact, it felt like I was two hours into Eat Pray Love before I started to question whether or not I had seen him in the TV spots. <br/><br/>There is so little of consequence taking place that I don&#39; t understand why this is a movie. Plenty of books have plots that don&#39; t equate into a two-hour film and many of those actually have tension. Liz&#39; s only conflict is from her own sociopath concepts. She&#39; s established early on as a poor playwright, highly gullible, and dare I say spoiled. These are not desirable traits. It&#39; s amazing how easily everyone accepts Liz. Italy, India, and Indonesia extend nothing but open arms and everyone who she turns to for advise is essentially the same character with the one exception being Richard from Texas (Richard Jenkins)—the sole character that doesn&#39; t seem to exist for Liz&#39; s personal amusement. I haven&#39; t seen such a patronizing, boring, alleged comedy in years. Eat Pray Love is a marathon that will surely test any burgeoning relationship and possibly cause a divorce. Girls, if your male friend can stomach this you&#39; ve either found an idiot or a liar. Pray for mercy. ",2

"This review may contain spoilers. You&#39; ve been warned. Twilight was a terrible film adaption of a, let&#39; s face it, mediocre novel. I went into the theater with an open mind, not expecting brilliance, but expecting to be entertained. Well, I guess I was technically entertained since I laughed throughout most of the movie. Sadly, I wasn&#39; t laughing at purposely funny moments. I was laughing at the awkward &quot; acting&quot; of the actors and the terrible dialogue. <br/><br/>Now this is where it gets tricky: Do we blame the screenwriter or the author? The movie made me realize just how corny the book&#39; s dialogue was. I found myself rolling my eyes, when I wasn&#39; t laughing, at every word out of the actor&#39; s mouth. Especially the dialogue between Edward and Bella. Now, the dialogue could have been over looked if the actors were able to deliver them. Alas, whoever decided to do casting for this film decided to cast every &quot; actor&quot; with the acting ability of a toaster. Now, a toaster is a inanimate object and therefore cannot act. Get the hint? What made me laugh the hardest was at the end of the movie when Bella&#39; s mother decides to inform Phil VIA TEXT MESSAGE that Bella is alright. I was so shocked that she was really texting him that I turned to my friend and whispered &quot; Bella&#39; s okay, L-O-L&quot; . Really, though. Text messages? I would think that informing your potential spouse of your child&#39; s well being would warrant a phone call at least. <br/><br/>Now, I have to point out the scene where Edward decides to flash Bella the goods. He want&#39; s to educate her in the ways of the vampire. He cannot go out into sunlight NOT because he&#39; ll burn or turn to dust, but because he turns into a failed children&#39; s art project. Reading the scene in the book I already knew whoever turned the book into a film was going to have issues with the scene. However, I really thought they&#39; d aim for something above spraying Robert Pattinson with water then dumping craft store glitter on him. I didn&#39; t even notice the &quot; sparkles&quot; at first. My friend turned to me and commented &quot; The sun hits him and he gets gross and sweaty?&quot; because, let&#39; s face it, that&#39; s what he looked like. Damp and dirty. Oh baby, I can hardly contain myself! I could go on and nit pick at everything, but I&#39; m just going to wrap it up and say this movie was awful and I&#39; m disappointed in the screenwriter as well as the director. I feel like Hardwicke was too focused on making the mise-en-scene beautiful and aesthetically pleasing, which is all well and good, but in doing so she over looked her cast of actors who would probably get over looked at a high school play audition with the way they displayed their acting abilities in this movie. Though, maybe I take back the part of being disappointed in the screenwriter since you can only do so much with the source material you&#39; re handed. <br/><br/>BRING ON THE TWILIGHT FANS! I CAN TAKE THEM! *Shields at maximum power!*",1
"I would give this movie no stars. . This movie is pathetic. I mean so pathetic. The acting was awful! <br/><br/>The movie starts well, but once they introduce the Cullens its pretty much downhill. Ashley Greene looks good as Alice, Jackson Rathbone looks constipated as Jasper, a wooden plank would have been a more convincing Edward. Robert Pattinson deserves the Razzie, second thought, his acting is so horrible that a razzie is like honoring him. <br/><br/>Vampires are supposed to be scary, when Edward scales trees he acts like a monkey, move over Kong! The baseball match looks like Super Mario Sluggers on steroids! Horrible. . <br/><br/>The scene where Edward glitters is pathetic. It looks someone dumped some glitter on him. . <br/><br/>On the other hand Charlie Swan and Jacob were spot on. <br/><br/>Over all the director tried too hard and lost it all. I strongly believe someone with more experience should direct a high profile film like this. This movie doesn&#39; t appeal as a Vampire movie or as a Romantic movie. Its pathetic. . <br/><br/>Jury",1
"Now do not be offended by any of this, this is just my opinion. <br/><br/>No I am not a rabid Twilight hater. I read the books, yes all of them. I thought they were interesting. Not very original, well thought out, or well written, but decent enough to read. I had several problems with this movie. It&#39; s not just the cast. Though I think Cam Gigandet did an excellent job as James. Okay my main problem with the cast was not really who they picked. I guess it boils down to the fact that Bella and Edward really are not that interesting. Is it so much to ask for a heroine who isn&#39; t so whiney and can take care of herself. Or maybe a vampire who isn&#39; t broody and boring and doesn&#39; t SPRAKLE! ((sorry that just bugs the **** out of me)) I think if they had stuck more to the actually book it would have been better. Granted, not by much, but it would have at least gotten 5 stars from me. <br/><br/>I do like the cinematography. The movie is gorgeous visually, and as i stated before the acting was not terrible. I would have picked different people for most of the cast, but thats me. I do have one more thing to say before i end this. <br/><br/>RABID TWIlIGHT FANS NEED TO CALM DOWN!!! ITS JUST A BOOK AND MOVIE SERIES!! don&#39; t take the fact that people don&#39; t like it to heart. if you like it, thats great. ",3
"That was my interpretation of this weekend that I had to endure working at my movie theater, all these little hormone crazed brace wearing under developed young girls who I think would&#39; ve just about died with the anticipation of seeing Twilight, I&#39; m not kidding, I personally witnessed a twelve year old say that she wanted to have Robert Pattinson&#39; s baby. OK, so how I saw the movie, my sister, ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books, after weeks of bugging me with it, I finally broke down and read them. Actually it&#39; s kind of a fun series, it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen. But of course she has to take me to the midnight premiere with 100, 000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down and crawling all over each other just to see a movie. <br/><br/>Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn&#39; t expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and beautiful Edward Cullen. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands - and he hasn&#39; t aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he&#39; s immortal. But he doesn&#39; t have fangs, and he doesn&#39; t drink human blood. <br/><br/>So, my opinion about Twilight the movie. . . honestly, it&#39; s average, it&#39; s my junior high romance with a vampire. I hate, beyond hate to say this, I&#39; m a hypocrite for saying this, but because I read the book before I saw the movie, I had this completely different interpretation of what the characters look like and how they say certain lines. Twilight the movie made me laugh more than anything simply because of the actors, Robert and Kristen are not bad actors, but the way they talked, I just couldn&#39; t take their &quot; love&quot; seriously. Peter Facinelli who played Carlisle Cullen, Edward&#39; s father, was exactly how I pictured and pulled in the best performance of the film. Is it worth the watch, absolutely if you&#39; re a fan of the books, otherwise, I would say if you just wanna see this movie, I recommend the matinée price because honestly, I think I may have lost my hearing after this weekend of the none stop screams from crazed teens. <br/><br/>5/10",5
"I&#39; ve never wanted to walk out of a movie so badly. I think you should give the film a chance to develop fully before forming an opinion. This was certainly not a &quot; film&quot; with any substance. The acting was horrible, the script was horrible, the whole thing was rushed and insubstantial. For being such a predicted box office hit, given the already large fan base, the budget must have been dismal. I think you would need to be no older than 10 to enjoy this film, but the kissing scene in Bella&#39; s bedroom was too passionate for a kid&#39; s movie (Bella&#39; s in her panties!?). In the books it takes them a long time to move forward with their physical relationship. The story was clearly written with teens in mind but still enjoyable for adults. The movie was a cringer. ",1
"Let&#39; s face it, the movie was a total let down. I had low expectations. Extremely low but the movie disappointed me even then. The amazing love story we all read in the books was transformed into a whiny preteen nightmare. There was chemistry between Robert and Kristen, there is no denying that, but I didn&#39; t feel the need that is in the books. They are supposed to be I-can&#39; t-live-without-you, take-me-forever, I&#39; m-devoted-to-you-always in love (Unless you want to count that one incident in Eclipse, but let&#39; s face it, most of us don&#39; t) but all I saw was a bored vampire and an indifferent girl. <br/><br/>The one thing that made me most angry was the complete disregard for the meadow scene. It is a VERY important part in the book where they pretty much declare themselves to each other. This meadow scene lasted all of 10 seconds and consisted of them staring at each other. They changed around the timing of the movie so much that it almost made no sense. Lets face it, the book was a good story but the writing wasn&#39; t up to par. It was pretty much written to be turned into a movie and the screenwriter obviously didn&#39; t realize that. <br/><br/>Sure, Robert was smoking hot (don&#39; t lie, you saw the ray bands) but his performance of Edward was terrible. The first time Bella walked into the Biology class, I laughed at his expression as did most people in the theater (some of them were too busy squealing). His badly-covered up English accent was also laughable. <br/><br/>Jasper was perfect, the person that made me laugh during the movie because if you looked, not at where the camera was focused, in most scenes you could see him lurking in the background and I think it fit his character well. Carlisle was cast to a T as were Esme, Jessica, Rosalie, Emmett and Alice. They all fit their parts well even if I imagined Alice a little bouncier, Emmett a little bigger and Rosalie a bit more bitchy. <br/><br/>Oh, the camera work. I&#39; m not denying it, I liked the flickers between scenes at times but after a while, it can give you a headache. The insane closeups did NOT do what they were supposed to (show the intensity) instead they made me where they were half the time and realize how much makeup the actors where wearing. Every time there was a close up on Robert, it was totally obvious he was wearing contacts. Seriously, look for the line. <br/><br/>The one thing that was actually done really well was the climax with the ballet studio and James. The fight scene was pretty cool and I totally believed that James wanted to kill Bella right there. But, with every up there is a down. After James is killed and They are taking care of Bella, why couldn&#39; t Edward have been more upset? It&#39; s written right in the book that he all but cries when he sees her. <br/><br/>The movie was hyped up to an extreme so it was obvious it would be a let down, I just didn&#39; t know how bad it actually was. I don&#39; t get why they couldn&#39; t do little things that would have made it a bit better; The biology class incident? Bella wearing blue? Why the hell did James have to bite her arm instead of her hand? Would that have been SO hard to change? All in all, go see it if you are a Twilight fan but be weary. If you aren&#39; t, stay away because you will not understand a thing that is going on. As I said in my title, somewhere, Edwards is rolling over in his hypothetical coffin (yes I know they don&#39; t sleep in coffins, or sleep period for that matter, but that&#39; s why it&#39; s hypothetical)",1
"NOTE: This review is the fair and unbiased opinion of someone with extremely little knowledge of the Twilight series. I watched the movie with a few die hard fans who I talked to after the movie, and I will work some of their thoughts into the review. <br/><br/>Another much loved book series has been brought to life in the form of Twilight, which despite having nothing in common with the Harry Potter series, will undoubtedly draw comparisons because of the furor and craze surrounding it. The main difference between the two, however, is that the Harry Potter films are generally good and solid films. Twilight, despite having done a couple things right, is not. <br/><br/>As a story, I will admit, Twilight is very catchy and interesting. Now I see what all the hype is about. If I was a young girl, I would go nuts over this stuff too. It&#39; s not just a vampire and a human falling in love with each other, but because of the two leads, it&#39; s one of the best on screen romances of the decade. This, however, is severely hurt by the fact that Twilight boasts easily some of the worst writing and editing I&#39; ve ever seen. Let&#39; s not forget about the horrid VFX and pasty makeup, either. It&#39; s one of the cheesiest films of the year, and can definitely be put in the category of &quot; so bad it&#39; s ALMOST good&quot; . Yes, I just invented that category. <br/><br/>The &#39; allure&#39; of the film appears to be the character played by Robert Pattinson, who ironically was previously known for his role in the Harry Potter series. Pattinson succeeded there and he more than succeeds again, as he more than fit the bill for what he needed to do with the character. Most actors would believe the only requirement of the character is to be good looking, but Pattinson takes it a step further and makes Edward Cullen very likable, trustworthy, and in the end, a good hero for the audience. Kristen Stewart is sort of the queen of not showing facial expressions, so she&#39; s perfect for the role of the awkward teen Bella Swann. However, there were sometimes where her lack of emotion bothered me. <br/><br/>Our supporting players. . . Well, none of them are noteworthy like Pattinson is. The villain of the film is lame, cheesy, and played by an actor I can&#39; t take seriously. Nikki Reed is probably the best as Rosalie, Edward&#39; s &#39; sister&#39; , and the antagonistic vibe felt from her adds a different side to the movie. <br/><br/>Okay, I don&#39; t really know what possessed the writer of this screenplay to make it so horrible (was it the source material?), because the dialog is just so bad that I laughed at serious moments. There&#39; s a lot of intentional humor, mostly in the beginning when Bella and Edward feel like awkward teens in love. I guess the movie moved along okay, because I wasn&#39; t bored at all. I was either laughing at how stupid the dialog was, laughing at some of the mildly funny jokes, or getting pulled in by the electric chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson. <br/><br/>That, folks, is the reason most people will be able to sit through this movie. The chemistry between the two leads, romantically and sexually, is amazing. In this respect, Pattinson and Stewart are perfectly cast and it makes me wonder if they could end up together in real life some day. I was very surprised by how much I liked seeing their one on one scenes, as cheesy and bad as the VFX and editing are. <br/><br/>As far as these visual effects go, I&#39; ve seen a few vampire movies in my day. I&#39; m going to assume director Catherine Hardwicke has seen a few. Well, she needs to watch a few more. Her fight scenes are horribly choreographed, terribly shot, and lack the intensity required to successfully rouse her audience. I could almost notice the wires the actors flew across on. I noticed a ton of errors with the editing as well, such as basic stuff like mouths moving and no words coming out, and words coming out when no mouths were moving. The fight scene at the end has wicked bad editing too, as the sound mixing also suffers as well. <br/><br/>All in all, with Twilight, as bad a movie as it may be, I couldn&#39; t help but stay interested in it because of the electric chemistry between the leads. That alone kept me in the seat the whole time. It is technically one of the worst films of the year, but the entertainment factor in the above respect keeps it out of the company of movies like Disaster Movie and College. I was actually lucky to see it with some of the fans of the book, and all of them (5) described the movie as a &#39; disappointment&#39; and that the film went &#39; half way&#39; with some subplots, either starting and dropping them, or randomly starting them halfway through an individual subplot. They were not happy at all with this movie, but agreed on one thing: Robert Pattinson was the perfect Edward Cullen. I&#39; ll agree with them on all those points and say that Twilight is exactly what I thought it would be: so bad it&#39; s ALMOST good. ",4
"This is just one person&#39; s opinion. No need to get angry, in fact I&#39; d like you to convince me I&#39; m wrong. <br/><br/>The movie is missing the magic. Edward appeared on screen and I swooned. He opened his mouth and I cringed. Edward is strong and confident. He wasn&#39; t a whiney, smitten child. In love yes, but brooding and in pain. Bella was delicate, not just dry and indifferent. This Bella lacked emotion maybe even a soul-who is she? She didn&#39; t feel like the yearning, thoughtful Bella I had imagined. I wished she needed to be protected. This version can take care of her own business--and I&#39; m not sure how bad she wants to be with Edward, or why for that matter. Maybe if she narrated her emotions would have been more pronounced. Don&#39; t get me wrong, the actors&#39; chemistry is very evident, they should get married and have melodramatic children. But was the film from Bella&#39; s perspective or not? The changing pov was off-putting. This film proves that Meyer&#39; s pages and pages are what bring this story and Edward and Bella&#39; s love to life. <br/><br/>The TONE was completely lost in the book to script to screen translation. The story is supposed to be a song that takes you to another world, one where vampires and werewolves exist. The story is an intoxicating melody. Here we&#39; re presented with a boy-band pop song sung by kids who think of themselves as classically trained Opera singers. PICK ONE. Be a chart-topping, America&#39; s Top 40 or be the haunting, dangerous lullaby I think a lot of fans were looking for. <br/><br/>Speaking of boy band. . . the screen version of Jacob Black is one &quot; Bye Bye Bye&quot; from being the lead singer in Over-Produced-Axe-Wearing-Guy-Group 2008. Jacob, in my mind, is earthy. He&#39; s a guy&#39; s guy and gets his hands dirty fixing cars and building stuff. Jacob always left me feeling like he was wise beyond his years, a smitten kitten of course, but I always felt that he was more dynamic than this cute little wig-wearing version. I always felt this sense of history and quiet power. This version wears Abercrombie (and randomly appears from behind trees apparently. . . you&#39; ll see). <br/><br/>The cast was quite OK for me. I did feel bad watching them try to deliver the lines they were given. I get that this is a vampire-romance movie, but honestly. The script is dripping in gooey, sticky, melted, mixed cheeses. OK, so it&#39; s fantastical, but to slap me in the face with Gouda and Brie every other frame is just insulting. <br/><br/>Cheese aside, Charlie was great. His timing was spot on. Carlisle played the part, but the caked-on white makeup so completely distracting. Esme-- I wanted to crawl up onto her lap and have her tell me bedtime stories. Love it. Alice. . . that&#39; s her on that screen. A little bouncier and she&#39; s perfect. Jasper-- freakishly creepy and pained, loved it. When he comes out of his shell and plays more than the wide-eyed silent sidekick, I&#39; m all over it. Those who doubted Reed need to reconsider. Rosalie is freaking hot and one sassy vamp. Emmett. . . holy crap, on the money (call me). Jessica is the best casting job in life. . . Mike, however. . . really?<br/><br/>I know that this is just a movie. Film is a different medium than books. We get to create the world from a book but people get to interpret for us on screen, I know. I just wish it wasn&#39; t so far off base for me. I wanted nothing more than to enjoy it. I think I&#39; m going to remember the series the way I imagined it and set this version aside. My oil canvas painting to their Polaroid. <br/><br/>Who&#39; s melodramatic now? This girl. <br/><br/>Here&#39; s hopping they make a choice for the next one: teen scene or dark love story so audiences know what they&#39; re getting into. Teenie Boppers are quite loyal, perhaps bubblegum will beef up their box office. ",5
"To preface this review, I read all four Twilight books in one weekend (last weekend, actually) when I picked the first one up at the airport, and could not put it down. I zipped through the other three and went to the midnight screening on opening day. To say the least, I was captivated by Twilight (and I&#39; m in my 20s. . . ). <br/><br/>I was anxious to see the movie because, like so many other people, I felt really invested in Bella and Edward&#39; s story. Not only that, but I love the vampire premise - it just never gets old, especially when you put a new spin on it, as Meyer did in her books. The events of each book really ran together for me, so in a way, I felt like a non-Twilighter coming into this film. I really didn&#39; t care if the movie deviated from the book - in fact, I was kind of hoping it would, since you can&#39; t expect a book to translate directly to the screen. I heard a lot of serious Twilight teens complaining about &quot; major things&quot; missing when I left the theater, but I honestly didn&#39; t notice any major omissions. <br/><br/>Overall, the film was better than I expected (based on previews, I expected it to be extremely cheesy, low-budget, and awkwardly filmed). It definitely grew on me as it went on, especially Pattinson&#39; s performance. His introduction was extremely awkward - not sure if that was Hardwicke&#39; s fault or Pattinson&#39; s acting. In any case, as soon as he settled into his character, he was absolutely captivating. Stewart plays a great brooder, and she certainly did that here. I loved the scenes with her father; in my opinion, these were some of the gems of the movie. <br/><br/>The romance between Edward and Bella, which was obviously the crux of the film, was fueled by their chemistry, but not much else. Where was the development?! I really wish Hardwicke or the screenwriter or somebody had taken more time to delve into the roots of their relationship. It all just happened way too fast. I feel like this happened because of the James story, which to me was almost completely unnecessary (yeah, I know, it&#39; s a big part of the book and obviously needs to be here). But even so, the film would have been a more moving romance, and probably a more poignant, emotional film, if that cheesy, goofy subplot hadn&#39; t existed. <br/><br/>Hardwicke dealt exceptionally well with teen angst, which was evident in the high school shots. Unfortunately, she really struggled with the vampire side of things. I have to put most of the blame on the director because the characters were all spot-on, very well-acted and well-cast. I also think a higher budget would have done wonders for this movie, and I&#39; m hoping that becomes a reality for the sequel. The special effects were embarrassingly bad, and nearly ruined the movie. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed &quot; Twilight&quot; for what it was - a romance that probed the timeless dilemma of wanting what you can&#39; t have (and despite Meyer&#39; s Mormon beliefs, this whole series is basically a metaphor for sex). It makes for an interesting, compelling story, and I expect more from the sequels, because the potential is certainly there. ",7
"I&#39; m going to voice my confusion here, a confusion which I have been burdened with for some time. I saw this movie with great glee, along with a full theater of those twelve year olds that are said to be so crazy about it. I sat, delighted through the whole thing as the whole theater raged with laughter through scene after scene. <br/><br/>For example, the &quot; cat scene&quot; in which a man&#39; s inner thoughts are revealed to be about his cat and he sighs in comedic distress. Or, the shimmering scene, when Edward dramatically builds up the fact that he is ultimately forever covered in body glitter. <br/><br/>Having enjoyed it so much, I read all the books. I giggled to myself as cheesy line after cheesy line poured forth. I bought the movie and re-watched it many many times. I even became jealous when my best friend got a hilarious life sized Edward doll with his signature super creepy expression. There were the plastic family crests being sold at borders and the great team Edward/team Jacob shirts being sold at target. <br/><br/>This underdog of comedy, this independent film on American society, was genius. The actors, which were the best of the teen stars they could get, had clearly been told to act as awkward as possible. To do as badly as they could. In fact I believe that was even stated in an interview at some point. . . <br/><br/>Why is everyone pretending this is a bad drama? Why does everyone think this is proof that teenagers are stupid? <br/><br/>hello. wake up. it&#39; s just a satire. . . none of those 12 year old teenage girls are taking this seriously. Were the critics even listening to the audience while they watched in horror? IT&#39; S A JOKE. ON PURPOSE. <br/><br/>and then. . . the second movie came out. And it was serious. And it was terrible. I was squirming in discomfort as the pedophile thoughts of someone my mother&#39; s age poured forth for a 17 year old night-walker. I waited for the humor. I pined for it. And it didn&#39; t come. what happened madam director? did the author catch on? did you fall for the news thinking these teenagers were serious? <br/><br/>I have no interest in seeing the third one, unless the satire returns. The first movie was so bad it was great. And the second movie was just enough better to be terrible. ",8
"The only thing I felt was right about this movie: the actors kind of resembled what the characters should have looked like. <br/><br/>The only performance I enjoyed was Charlie. I personally always thought of Charlie as a more rounded person, but I adjusted to a slimmer version (makes sense seeing as Bella is slim. . . but then again all Charlie does is fish, watch T. V. and sit at the police station since there&#39; s no problems in Forks. Makes me feel like he would have a slow metabolism). I actually believed the words coming out of Charlie&#39; s mouth when he said them. <br/><br/>I expected more out of Kristen (Bella). I figured Rob (Edward) would ruin the movie, I came prepared for that. What I did not expect was Steward&#39; s inability to complete a sentence (any one else notice how she started and interrupted her lines with a lot of scoffing and stuttering? Note the hospital scene: &quot; Wh- what? What. . . uh what are you saying? Like- wh- like what are you even saying? I don&#39; t- don&#39; t. . . i don&#39; t even know what you&#39; re saying&quot; (Neither do we Kristen) ). <br/><br/>And Rob lived up to my extremely low expectations. He tried too hard. That&#39; s an understatement. He tried so hard that I felt the veins in my forehead about to burst. Every scene between him and Steward is awkward. Were they going for awkward? Because that&#39; s what it was. The book&#39; s charm was truly absent in this movie. Perhaps Meyer&#39; s talent and vision is something no one else can try to reproduce on screen. <br/><br/>Alice was mediocre. She&#39; s supposed to be more bubbly. And she would have never let Bella go to prom in that blue JC Penny dress with the grandma sweater. And why is Victoria showing up at a high school prom? She&#39; s supposed to be licking her wounds and planning her next attack of revenge, not watching Edward and Bella dance!<br/><br/>The rest of the vampires didn&#39; t get enough screen time for me to really judge them. Like I said, they looked the part. But so did the leading roles, until they opened their mouths. <br/><br/>It&#39; s a shame that the books that I have come to love were portrayed like this. I have waited for months, checking Meyer&#39; s website daily for any new clips, interviews. . . anything! And it came down to me and my not happy b/f shaking our heads sadly when we should have been in complete awe. <br/><br/>The only thin worse than this was watching Hayden Chrisensen play an emotional Anakin. . . Jedis don&#39; t cry, you wuss. ",1
"After the enormous flurry of attention Stephanie Meyer&#39; s literary series attracted (a unique hybrid of Romeo and Juliet style teenage angst and hormonal lust and supernatural horror), a cinematic adaptation seemed not only inevitable but almost expected, providing sultry visuals to the tale of starstruck lovers and proving the definitive date movie for months to come. However, the curse of mainstream literary adaptations proves inescapable, with excitement surrounding the release leading to the film being somewhat unreasonably over-hyped. And while Twilight is hardly a complete failure of a film by any standards, there remains the inescapable sense of its existence being geared to match up to a set standard rather than simply aiming to succeed as a film, making for the overall result being uniformly disappointing, whether for fans of the source material or those unfamiliar with the novels. <br/><br/>Few Hollywood productions have the concern of appealing to both the demographics flocking to romances and supernatural action films, and as such, the impression is frequently given of Twilight biting off more than it can chew. This indecision between concentrating on the supernatural or romantic facets of the film leads to one of the more glaring flaws of the picture - the sense of neither being devoted enough focus to truly excel. While the climactic battle is gruesomely effective, for the most part, the film&#39; s special effects appear rushed, under-budgeted and just plain sloppy, coasting by on horrendously unconvincing slow motion to represent vampire super-speed and making moments which should have been filled with wonder and awe instead evoke unintentional laughs and groans. However, Meyer&#39; s revisionist take on vampire lore is intriguing, and the viewer wishes the film had delved into the technical aspects of immortal vampire lifestyles further - a sequence where protagonist Bella slowly begins to suspect the true identity of the mysterious boy she has found herself involved with is impressively eerie and chilling. Such moments are aided incalculably by the tremendous musical score of Carter Burwell, whose bold mix of brassy Gothic themes and eerie, chilling motifs perfectly compliments the intensity of the film. <br/><br/>However, Twilight&#39; s main concern lies in its script, which boasts some particularly gruesome patches of dialogue apart from the general lack of characterisation one has sadly grown to expect from the teen romance genre. Similarly, despite director Catherine Hardwicke appearing to be the perfect candidate to helm such a film (with directorial debut Thirteen demonstrating a keen knowledge of the teenage girl mentality), her handling of the source material is unfortunately shaky. The film repeatedly falls prey to the &quot; Harry Potter syndrome&quot; , feeling somewhat clunky in its almost robotic adherence to its source material, giving it the sense of jumping awkwardly from plot point to plot point and lacking the necessary cohesion and narrative flow. <br/><br/>But most importantly, for a film revolving around its central romantic attraction and sexual tension, the audience is never really given the chance to FEEL the romance, to be drawn in by the mutual lust and entrapment of the two leads for one another. In an oddly rushed sequence, the budding romance between protagonists Bella and Edward is reduced to a couple of nonchalant sessions of hanging out, mostly demonstrated through montage, after which Bella&#39; s (largely unnecessary) narration declares her unequivocal love for Edward. This rather abrupt transition would toe the line of appearing satirical of teenage romance were it not for the fact that the viewer realises the moment is meant to be completely heartfelt. What was likely far more effective in literary form, with the chance to understand Bella&#39; s emotions and mental process making the romance far more credible does not translate into film. As such, with this crucial central romance lacking the necessary spark which made the novel such a success, Twilight, for all of its periodic cinematic potential, just feels somewhat unnecessary. <br/><br/>The film&#39; s casting is perfectly passable, supplying a sufficient variety of up and coming pristine teenage beauties capable of essaying their character types, yet for a book which was driven by such genuine intensity and passion, one can&#39; t help thinking of all the performances as somewhat listless and flat. While Kristen Stewart makes a passable romantic lead as headstrong Bella, she lacks the necessary charismatic spark to truly make the viewer warm to her, making her teenaged-angst interludes harder to empathise with. Robert Pattinson does his best as teenage dreamboat vampire Edward, sharing strong chemistry with Stewart, even if his &quot; sultry, moody glances&quot; delve into the melodramatic to the point of verging on comical at times. The rest of the cast give rather bland but serviceable performances, the standouts being Cam Gigandet who is mercifully given the chance to gleefully chomp on scenery and generate sufficient menace as sadistic villainous vampire James and Ashley Greene who essays the ideal balance of being sweetly charming without being overly chirpy as Edward&#39; s kind-hearted sister Alice. However, despite his best efforts, Billy Burke is forced to wade through &quot; stern but absent father&quot; clichés to the point of being almost invisible as Bella&#39; s emotionally stunted parental figure, and Taylor Lautner fares little better as mysterious prospective love interest Jacob. <br/><br/>While Twilight is hardly a failure on all fronts, with a sporatic peppering of effective moments, the word which most ably describes the film as a whole is &#39; passable&#39; , lacking the necessary intensity or impact to truly hit home. It is easy to envision the adaptation being far more satisfying if done as a smaller, independent production outside the shadow of Hollywood, one which would not shy away from capturing the true passion and intensity of the central relationship without baulking at the prospect of a simmering yet sexless teenage relationship. As is, Hardwicke&#39; s film is content to succumb to cliché and sloppy, complacent storytelling, making it far too &#39; bloodless&#39; to truly satisfy. <br/><br/>-4/10",4
"Okay, I just got back from watching &quot; Twilight&quot; and I must say, cheesiest, choppiest, worst characterization of a movie I have seen in years and by far the worst Book adaptation I&#39; ve ever seen! It even beat my discontentment with Ella Enchanted. <br/><br/>As avid readers, we do not go to a movie to see &quot; surprises&quot; or script changes! We go to the movie to see our favorite books displayed out in front of us to see how our minds and visuals compare. <br/><br/>Bella was suppose to be funny, she was way too bloody serious! Kristen go get some facial expressions, terror is not love and looking insensitive all the time is not what the character Bella is all about! She&#39; s so clumsy it&#39; s funny, she&#39; s sarcastic, you took out ALL of my favorite lines! And their should have been more chemistry between Jacob and Bella, it&#39; s like hey look their vamps, haha now you can leave. She&#39; s comical, did you even read the book? <br/><br/>Edward, don&#39; t&#39; look so constipated all the time. Like jeez you&#39; re suppose to be tense, not looking like you had too much carbohydrates and not enough water. Not only that you didn&#39; t&#39; portray Edward&#39; s genuine gentleman side at all, the loving chivalrous side! And where is that infamous half smile! Honestly i&#39; ll make a list for all of your characters! An essay about each and everyone on how readers want them portrayed and what scenes we could do with out. <br/><br/>Alice was awesome, Jasper, very nice! Rosalie, hell down pat! Emmet, please face baseball cap forward, it&#39; s annoying. actually don&#39; t wear hats, Emmet&#39; s not wangster and you look hot without it. Carlisle please cause some more fatherly emotion but good! Esme, you do alright. <br/><br/>One question plagues me though. . . WHY WEREN&quot; T THEY GIVEN MORE LINES? Like jeez! I understand your need to save time because no one wants to sit through a six hour movie but if it had to be three and a half hours, we&#39; d enjoy it! <br/><br/>Jacob Black, awesome casting!!!! But give him more lines, I saw Tyler Lautner in Sharkboy and Lavagirl, he&#39; s a really good actor, ACTUALLY why don&#39; t you JUST FOLLOW THE BOOK!! Come on everyone loved Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. I read those books and especially in Harry Potter didn&#39; t&#39; have any troubles with their movie adaptations, actually i didn&#39; t realized when they changed something! OK maybe some chapters were taken out but it didn&#39; t ruin the overall point and it was funny loving and mischievous. I loved those books and those movies. <br/><br/>The chemistry between Bella and Edward was lacking. <br/><br/>I actually didn&#39; t care to get up and go bathroom in between, i pretty much didn&#39; t&#39; care to miss any of it. THIS IS A POPULAR BOOK! You&#39; re adaptation sucked major insignificant crap. I mean just look at your movie rating! For a book that beat Harry Potter&#39; s final book, I mean best seller&#39; s list and it was Eclipse the second last book of the series and it beat out the final book to HARRY POTTER. Couldn&#39; t you have taken a little more time on it. And where was Alice and Jasper and Rosalie and Emmet at the end in the prom scene? <br/><br/>I honestly do not care if you continue on with the movies, actually I&#39; d prefer it if you didn&#39; t. You have ruined my vision of it, you&#39; re killing your fan base. Unless you guys give the next one some extra spark and actually start listening to your fans, you can forget about a wide fan base. I absolutely hated the movie. I felt sorry for those who didn&#39; t read the books because they had NO CLUE what was going on it was so choppy!!! I couldn&#39; t even tell when the next day started, all of a sudden, Edward &quot; I would like you to meet my family&quot; next two minutes, &quot; wow you have a really nice house. . . &quot; um. . . hello did she sleep? DID I FALL ASLEEP? I think i missed something, oh no wait, you did. It&#39; s called nightfall. Where was the talk about twilight? How it is the beginning and ending of a day. . . ? Or about her talking in her sleep. He looked like a weird serial killer stalking her in her sleep. WHERE WERE THE FUNNY PARTS! I had more fun and made my friends laugh by making my own commentary during the film, i even made people i didn&#39; t know who sat in front of me in the theater burst out laughing from my commentary then your boring movie did. <br/><br/>As readers we expect the book to be taken seriously, and adapted to screen, NOT BASED, ADAPTED!!!!!! I&#39; ve taken Communication Production Tech class in my high school writing my own scripts, so I know script writing agony, i&#39; m also writing my own book. So if i was to ever sign off my book to make it a screen version I&#39; d make darn sure it took more than a few SLOPPY months to make, with a CAST WHO READ THE BOOK FIRST AND RESEARCHED THEIR CHARACTER! Honestly, can you seriously give me an answer about how many cast members actually, i mean truly read all the books? I&#39; m sure hardly any of them did. <br/><br/>This by far is the biggest disappointment I have seen in years and I&#39; m only eighteen. <br/><br/>ADAPTION IS NOT THE SAME AS BASED ON!!! PEOPLE HONESTLY! Anyone who says they loved the movie did not care much for the characters or shares the same love as Stephenie Meyer does for her books. This was rushed, unorganized, ill plan, deceitful, and horrid. <br/><br/>You&#39; re lacking the spunk, zest, fire, passion, integrity, and the complete ethics of what made the TWILIGHT SERIES!",3
"Catherine Hardwicke, please put the camera down. You have absolutely no talent and yes, it does bother me that your daughter does get into every movie you direct. This could&#39; ve been the greatest film of 2008 but your filthy little hands seem to have gotten on my favorite author. First of all, why in the world is Bella as pale as the vampires? I get that she doesn&#39; t tan, but she does still have a pulse according to the book. (Maybe you should read it. I mean, it is just based on the written version of Twilight. ) I felt as if I had not read the book, I would have no idea what was going on in the movie, which in my opinion, isn&#39; t how a movie should present itself. UGH! GET ME A NEW DIRECTOR!!!",1
"To be honest, I was extremely disappointed with the way this movie turned out. <br/><br/>The hype for it was monumental and I am a die-hard fan of the series myself so I expected a lot from it. I&#39; m still in shock with how fantastically horrible it turned out. <br/><br/>The acting, for one, has to be the worst I have ever seen. Robert Patterson was supposedly perfect for the part of Edward, but not only was he not handsome enough to be Edward but he completely butchered all the lines that Edward had in the novel. His voice was too slow and hesitant, whereas Edward was supposed to be composed and highly intelligent. The changes that he underwent in the novel were not at all apparent once they were transferred to the screen. As for the part of Bella, Kristen Stewart suited Bella very well physically, but when it came to acting she also fell short. Her speech was consistently monotone and both her and Edward had a problem with saying the word &quot; um&quot; or pausing abruptly when there should be lines filled with quirky sayings or questions that they throw at each other. Most of the other actors were actually okay, but the lack of skill portrayed by the two main stars completely ruined the movie for me. <br/><br/>The scenes were also very different from the book. Perhaps showing multiple scenes of the mountains and the lake and trees was the Director&#39; s way of distracting the viewer from the horrendous slaughter of the Twilight novel that this movie was? Not only was the high school a LARGE high school, unlike that in the book, but very few scenes took place in there. No lunchroom chats between Bella and Edward took place except for one short one while standing in line. The Biology scene where they meet was excessively melodramatic and almost sickening in its portrayal of their initial reactions to each other. The majority of the scenes took place in the surrounding forest, which honestly did not play a large part in the book. Plenty of other scenes are butchered by this movie, but the worst one of all was the field scene where Bella and Edward were to have their first date. Rather then make it as romantic and planned as they had it in the story, they introduce this scene by having Bella somehow magically walk all the way from her school up into the woods where she tells him that she knows he&#39; s a vampire and then he drags her up to a field to show her what he looks like in the light. They have a short confrontation (that does follow the lines in the book, but is acted so horrendously that I many women in the theatre groaned with dismay) in which Edward pulls a tree up and then they lay down (in an extremely uncomfortable and unnatural position) and the scene ends. <br/><br/>The melodramatic nature of the entire movie, heightened by a score that was not at all suited for the true nature of Twilight, was a complete mood-killer. Even the action scenes were very old-fashioned and could have been done with better technology and filming. Overall, it was a huge letdown. I have to say that I don&#39; t think I&#39; ll ever be able to read Twilight again. This movie is, without a doubt, the worst movie I have ever seen. Plenty of you fans can attack me for this comment, but the simply fact of the matter is that the Twilight movie could have and should have been so much better. ",3
** SPOILER ** This is just about the worst movie I have ever seen. If there was not so much hype about the book this movie would have went straight to DVD or the garbage. This is nothing like the book. It was almost like the screenwriter had to change absolutely everything no matter how insignificant the detail. Don&#39; t even rent this. I am so sad I just love these books. I am reading through them for the third time. Bella acting was horrible. She seemed to hate Edward more than anything. She had no emotions. Most scenes felt very awkward. Edward was not pale. Edward had no dark circles under his eyes. Edward in the sunlight AWFUL AWFUL. I can only hope they remake this. The book was way too good for this. It is just sad. ,1
"Good adaptation? Excellent movie? I hope those of you writing these reviews never watch another movie again. I&#39; m marking it as &quot; spoiler&quot; because it MIGHT contain some small ones, but if you go see this movie, it&#39; s already spoiled, rotted, and dessicated without any help from me. <br/><br/>This movie stank. It was inept on almost every level. The acting was mediocre at best, the characters were poorly developed, the camera work was painful at times, the effects were laughably bad, the wirework is the worst I&#39; ve ever seen, and the whole story is so ludicrous that I wanted to rip my hair out. <br/><br/>First off, these aren&#39; t vampires. Dracula was a vampire. These &quot; vampires&quot; have almost nothing in common aside from drinking blood and being immortal and. . . wait, that&#39; s it. They walk in the daylight (and ooh! They sparkle, because teenie girls love sparkles!), they don&#39; t have fangs, they don&#39; t sleep in coffins, turn into bats, don&#39; t have an aversion to silver or garlic, walk over running water, don&#39; t mind crosses. . . the list goes on. Some of that is forgivable, but all of it? Nope. This is yet another pop-culture pussification of vampires, turning them into something ludicrous and throwing almost all the mythology out the window. Give me a nightwalking, bloodsucking, evil minion of the devil any day of the week. Don&#39; t call the Twilight &quot; vampires&quot; by that name because, quite frankly, they&#39; re not. <br/><br/>Was the director of this movie high the whole time? Did she bother to try directing the actors, much less go over their dialog and realize that no normal human being would talk like that? The culmination of the two would be Bella blubbering in bed at the end for Edward to not leave her. I almost burst out laughing, but by then my soul had been sapped to the point that I thought laughter would be impossible. And I think her only direction for the vampires was, &quot; Okay, ready, set, ACTION! Okay guys, SMOLDER! SMOLDER! SMOLDER!&quot; , because that&#39; s about the extent of the vampire &quot; acting&quot; in this movie. Lots of smoldering looks and very little else. And couldn&#39; t she have made sure the effects weren&#39; t awful? Seriously, who could have seen the fast vampire effect and thought it looked better than Scifi channel original movie effects? Did the director blow all the budget on crack to use while she was making this? And what was with the horrid wirework? Seriously. Watch Edward jumping from his window to the tree outside and see how he moves in a perfectly straight line. Watch the bad vampire jump over Bella and watch how his trajectory dips, then arcs UP, then drops in front of her. It&#39; s unbelievable. And did anyone else notice how the camera-work in the woods when Bella says she knows that Edward is a vampire was pointless and utterly distracting? Sorry, but that&#39; s not a good way to convey what was happening. Try again. Oh, wait, the studio decided you couldn&#39; t. Sorry. <br/><br/>Why the heck is Edward so dreamy? He&#39; s a creepy stalker! He sneaks into Bella&#39; s room at night and watches her sleep? Oooh, so romantic! I sneak into a girl&#39; s room at night to watch her sleep? Pepper spray, a boot to the balls, and lots of community service. He follows her around wherever she goes? Nah, not stalking at all. He&#39; s just enamored with her and it&#39; s sooo dreamy! What a hairy load. Setting aside his saving her life twice (a contrivance so they can speed things up and they don&#39; t have to make them fall in love the old fashioned way), Edward could do anything to her and it would be so wonderful. I cannot understand that. Maybe that&#39; s why so many women will date total jerks and excuse everything they do. It explains a lot, actually. <br/><br/>Sorry, but his movie is crap. Those who love it are likely so whipped up into a fervor about the book being turned into a movie that they&#39; d watch anything with Edward in it. It could be Hostel 3: Vampire Style with Edward ripping limbs off of Bella in a bloodbath and it would be wonderful to them. Girls, I know you&#39; re obsessed with this fictional character in ways that only hardcore comic book nerds could ever hope to match, but please, step out of that bubble and actually WATCH the movie. Please. We don&#39; t need any more lazy, crappy cinema staining the multiplex screens. There&#39; s enough of that coming out of Hollywood these days. My wife loves the books (and I get to hear all about them. . . groan), but at least she&#39; s not so wrapped up in it that she couldn&#39; t admit the movie sucked. She&#39; s at least got that going for her. Other fans with claw your eyes out if you dare speak ill of it. Makes me wanna puke. ",1
"I&#39; m an avid Twilight reader and stalker (yes I went to Hot Topic tour. ) I can&#39; t remember a time when I was SO anxious and excited to see a movie. I just saw Twilight at a screening in San Francisco on 11/17. I left the theatre feeling. . indifferent. <br/><br/>First of all, I knew the movie was not going to be based exactly to the books but at the same time it kind of hurts me to say that it just wasn&#39; t good. ~sigh I felt that the director Catherine tried to bring her indie elements into the Hollywood style movie that just didn&#39; t work. The opening scene with the deer was alright, but I was just about to laugh out loud when the movie got to Edward and Bella finally acknowledging what Edward truly was. This was the biggest issue I had. I didn&#39; t think viewers were able to experience the intensity of Bella and Edward relationship. I wouldn&#39; t believe that Bella was ready to place her undying pledge to go vamp at the end. The scene was so choppy, where it felt like the scene was full of greatest hits of one liners all cram into this one scene. It wasn&#39; t the turning point as where it should have been. The movie was clearly not based on romance, which is the ultimate theme of the book. The movie hastily breezed through the courtship development to finally get to the lingering action sequence. <br/><br/>I like Robert but he just couldn&#39; t pull off a convincing Edward. His reaction to Bella in Biology class was just laughable. Again Catherine trying to pull the artsy camera cuts--- silly, silly. Jasper&#39; s reaction was humorous also. <br/><br/>Edward&#39; s showing Bella who he was in the sun was not remarkable. His body hardly glisten. Couldn&#39; t they get Britney&#39; s Swarovski body suit from her &quot; Toxic&quot; video? The movie nicely brought out Rosalie&#39; s dislike for Bella. Alice was very convincing and good. Carlise was attractive and fitting. <br/><br/>I was surprised by the diverse student body of Forks. I liked Jessica a lot. It was hard to see her as the small minded character as how she was written in the book. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie wasn&#39; t made for fans of the book, but to lure moviegoers into (hopefully) the film franchise. <br/><br/>Little things that could have been included in the movie to make the readers happy wasn&#39; t included. Such as why couldn&#39; t Bella wear the blue V neck sweater when meeting the Cullens for the first time? Why couldn&#39; t Bella attack Edward on the onset of their first kiss? Why couldn&#39; t Edward&#39; s couch be black? Why did James bite Bella on her forearm and not her hand? <br/><br/>As a Twilighter, I think I may go see it again just to see if my reactions change, but I wouldn&#39; t recommend this film to any non-Twilighters.

"OK, so I read the 4 books in 5 days while my husband was out of town. They are certainly not going to be classics, but I will admit that I (mostly) enjoyed them. <br/><br/>I dragged the hubby to see the movie tonight, and let&#39; s just say it was payback for the time he made me see Silent Hill<br/><br/>First off it was totally miscast. Bella could not complete a sentence to save her life, and was absolutely unappealing. Edward was supposed to be the most beautiful and charming man on earth, instead he was a clumsy and bizarro stalker There was zero chemistry between them. . . and their chemistry is kind of the basis of the book. Jasper looked and acted like a constipated Edward Scissorhands. Esme was sweet and at least looked about like I would have expected. The other Cullens were not in the movie enough to decide if I liked them or not. <br/><br/>The special effects and makeup were just weird! The flying, jumping, climbing, &amp; running stuff I swear they just looked to be dangling from cords. The big ballet studio fight was passable. . . only the bad guy James was just not that bad. . . and the end where Edward sucks the venom out??? Good Lord it was bad. <br/><br/>If I were Catherine Hardwicke I would be very very ashamed. The screenplay must have been God awful. . . <br/><br/>In short, I alternated between embarrassed for everyone involved, verging on hysterical laughter from beginning to end, and thinking that I should have just gotten my $10 worth and hopped into the next theater where Changeling was playing. <br/><br/>If you liked the book stay far far away from this movie",1
"Although the marketing blitz and the huge crowds of screaming teenage girls would suggest something of a cultural phenomenon, the movie just fell flat on it&#39; s face in spite of the hype. This story could have been told in a 20 minute short, and could have been just as effective. <br/><br/>The washed out colors to add &quot; dreariness&quot; (I&#39; m assuming) gave me a bit of a headache. Miss Stewart - however cute she may be - seemed to be only given one direction, and that was to &quot; stare longingly into his face with your lips slightly open&quot; . The softball game was ridiculous. The &quot; 300&quot; style of editing infuriates me to no end, and it&#39; s been WAY overdone lately. Plus, the &quot; Ozzie and Harriet with fangs&quot; family scene was painfully stupid. I really don&#39; t know what the attraction of this storyline is, but apparently all you need is 2 good looking actors, some sexual tension, and an edgy soundtrack and it&#39; s all gravy. This was one of the most shallow movies I&#39; ve seen in years. Save your money. ",1
"After his last holiday-themed box-office smash Valentine&#39; s Day in 2010, director Garry Marshall has carbon-copied the exact same formula for his latest film New Year&#39; s Eve which uses its gigantic ensemble cast to document various different relationships and states of emotions over the course of a single day and night in New York City. <br/><br/>The story lines include: a couple awaiting the birth of their child, two people who become trapped together in an elevator and a gentleman who is trying to enjoy his last New Year&#39; s Eve on earth as he sadly lays on his deathbed. <br/><br/>Much like Valentine&#39; s Day, Marshall&#39; s latest film seems to forget the importance of character development and indeed sure-footed narrative; these films feel like the audience are watching Ashton Kutcher flirt with Lea Michele, or Zac Efron helping Michelle Pfeiffer, which – in all honesty – they are. Never are viewers able to break away from the celebrities portraying these supposed characters, which cause great issues when trying to build and present emotion. <br/><br/>The film also has some bizarre cast members, including the incredibly pointless Jon Bon Jovi who slinks about, and may as well be promoting a new Greatest Hits album when he enters the frame. Stars like Halle Berry and Robert De Niro are incredibly redundant here, even though they do benefit from moderate screen-time. Performers like De Niro are worthy of a solid script and something more important to do rather than just stand around holding a theoretical sign saying &#39; And Robert De Niro&#39; . <br/><br/>Contrary to the opinion of the majority of critics (or males), &#39; Valentine&#39; s Day&#39; was yes fluffy, gooey and forgettable two hours, but also entertaining. It did try very slightly to be different – with a gay romance amongst other things – and whilst this was all still &quot; Hollywood&quot; , there were far worse movies released in 2010. <br/><br/>To be fair to &#39; New Year&#39; s Eve&#39; , it is not amongst the worst of the year. This might be due to the fact that most of the audience had or have extremely low expectations upon arrival. Expecting a film to be bad makes it all the less painful if the final product is indeed poor and consequently, makes it seem much better than it truly is if a viewer is not disappointed. <br/><br/>&#39; New Year&#39; s Eve&#39; felt mechanical and forced, a project merely designed for profit – there is no love nor compassion, no credibility nor realism. This is rather a 118 minute tourist video about how wonderful The Big Apple is, and how beautiful the people who reside in it are. Throw in disgusting amounts of product placement and an old rock star, and hey, you&#39; ve got a $100 million motion picture! Spend your £8 at the cinema this Christmas on a film that gives like &#39; Hugo&#39; rather than this, and save the holiday romances for &#39; Love Actually&#39; on DVD with the family or partner. <br/><br/>Verdict:  It is better if Marshall does not attempt to make another movie about a commercial holiday again. If we see a trailer with Kutcher dressed as the Easter Bunny for love next year, run for your life. <br/><br/>For more The Upcoming reviews http: //www. theupcoming. co. uk/category/culture/cinema/",4
"I don&#39; t think I understand people at all. I watched it despite all the bad reviews and I didn&#39; t regret it. I&#39; m starting to think people are really bitter, it&#39; s a really sweet movie about new years and how people feel around that time of the year, it actually gave me a warm feeling, so yes, it&#39; s not a deep smart full of effects movie, but sometimes people need a movie like this, I&#39; m all against unchallenging movies, but I don&#39; t think this was the case at all. It&#39; s the perfect new year movie, that gives you hope for the year to come and live everyday fully. The variety of characters is okay, as you get to know them enough to see a little bit of yourself in them or not, and it&#39; s really interesting to see what different people go through at that time of the year and how they feel and what they hope to change. It really is a warm, hopeful movie, at least that&#39; s the way I saw it. Sometimes we need to take a break and take a deep breath, that&#39; s the movie. ",7
"The trouble with ensemble comedies - romantic or otherwise - is that the audience is given little time to develop a relationship with any of their characters. This is certainly the case with Garry Marshall&#39; s seasonal effort New Years Eve, but the problems with the film are far from done there. <br/><br/>Stuck somewhere between a &#39; Visit New York&#39; advert and meandering rom-com, few of the movies plots are linked and many are only hastily so at the end of the movie, almost as an afterthought. The film is incredibly low on laughs of any variety and despite - or perhaps because of - its huge star cast it never feels like its going anywhere, much like the Times Square ball which gets as much screen time as anybody. <br/><br/>The characterisation is incredibly lazy; Ashton Kutcher plays a pyjama-wearing stoner cartoonist, Zac Efron is the plucky young go-getter, De Niro (who will sign up for anything these days) is the grumpy old coot. These typecasts are bad enough before Lea Michele appears essentially playing Rachel Berry from Glee, replete with the screeching vocal performances. The cherry on top of the cake, however, is Michelle Pfeiffer who re-enacts her performance in Batman Returns as kooky wallflower Selina Kyle; to my immense disappointment she never became Catwoman and proceeded to whip up any sense of excitement. <br/><br/>The one positive thing I could say about this film is that it isn&#39; t offensively bad, except I cant because three of the precious few non-white, non-American characters are horrendously bad racial stereotypes. I&#39; ll leave you to spot them should you have the misfortune of having to endure this vapid exercise in futility. ",2
"What? It&#39; s not a sequel to Valentine&#39; s Day? <br/><br/>Let&#39; s be honest here. There was absolutely NO reason to make this movie. Well, maybe one: money. During a viewing of this excruciatingly painful melo-dramedy, one will find absolutely no artistic value, underlying message, or actual creative backbone. This film is just an excuse to slap a couple of famous face in front of the same camera, within the same period of time. You know what that&#39; s called on the set of a good movie? Bad casting. <br/><br/>I can&#39; t believe someone made the same mistakes that were made just a year or two ago! When I first saw the poster, I thought &quot; Is this a  parody?&quot; . But then I saw who was directing this prick of a film. <br/><br/>Garry Marshall: Probably the single most desperate man in America. I am convinced that his last and final wish (let&#39; s be honest, he&#39; s not exactly in his twenties) is to meet as many famous people as he can; and what does that leave the helpless moviegoers with? The atrocities that were (and still are) Valentine&#39; s Day and New Years Eve. <br/><br/>Looking for a fun holiday film to put a spring in your step, and a sparkle in your smile? Then spend your ten bucks elsewhere, because this movie is not worth the dough. <br/><br/>The whole thing is a jumbled mess of popular actresses of today, and a few familiar faces that we all know. Then of course your Ashton Kutcher and your Jessica Biel who insist upon us that &quot; Yes look, we&#39; re still famous! We promise!&quot; <br/><br/>Well I don&#39; t need it. I don&#39; t need it, and I encourage everyone to stray far away from this badly written, far-fetched, soap cushion of a love story that sincerely wants to be literally everything that it&#39; s not. It&#39; s a drama for people who don&#39; t like dramas, a comedy for people who don&#39; t like comedies, and a romance for people who don&#39; t like romance. Not worth a second of your time. ",3
"The latest in a long line of vapid group ensemble romcoms quickly becoming popular in Hollywood – Valentine&#39; s Day, He&#39; s Just Not That Into You, etc, etc – is devoid of anything even remotely resembling quality movie-making or quality entertainment. It&#39; s a hodgepodge of inane mini stories, hammy acting, ridiculous moralising and ludicrous plotting all converging to produce a sickly sweet holiday flick that should be avoided by all. I&#39; m not sure what&#39; s more disconcerting, that Valentine&#39; s Day was triumphant enough at the box office to warrant this semi-spin off or that some of the usually terrific actors present here – Michelle Pfeiffer, Hilary Swank, Abigail Breslin, Halle Berry, Robert De Niro – decided to sign on the dotted line for this junk. Give this puke-fest a miss or you may actually want to skip the real New Year&#39; s Eve this year. ",2
"This movie was so bad it is the reason I joined IMDb. I thought about joining in the past for good movies, but never have I been so motivated by a movie to do something to help others. Save yourself and DO NOT see this movie. Great actors, but horrible plot and writing. Which any movie buff knows it doesn&#39; t matter if the actors/actresses are on the level of Robert De Niro/Hale Berry or Kevin Federline/Jenifer Lopez, if the story is bad, nothing can save the movie. To Hollywood: Stop making stink bombs like this! Stop insulting the intelligence of your audiences. Save yourselves and your loyal followers from future pointless junk like this. ",1
"I&#39; m speculating that one of the reasons why New Year&#39; s Eve got pushed up so early in the month is because come that time of the season everyone will be out there merry making rather than to head to the cinemas and probably revel in whatever festivities the welcoming of the new year will bring, instead of watching something that failed to capture the mood and spirit of leaving behind the old and being hopeful for what the new year would hold. Yes, for all its celebratory mood seen in the trailer, the actual product is nothing more than a really boring affair culminating in the New York Times Square ball drop at the stroke of midnight. <br/><br/>Garry Marshall continues from his festival theme film Valentine&#39; s Day with yet another ensemble that rounds up some of the hottest folks in Hollywood, playing caricatures in 8 short stories that you know will link up one way or another, either through characters or through events. There&#39; s Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer) the mousy secretary of a music executive (John Lithgow) who quit her job to fulfill her New Year&#39; s resolution with the help of a courier boy (Zac Efron). Then we have Robert De Niro as a patient on his death bed persuading his doctor (Cary Elwes) and his nurse (Halle Berry) to let him see the countdown from the rooftop of the hospital. Jessica Biel and Seth Meyers play a couple who are expecting their child, and are in competition with another couple played by Sarah Paulson and Til Schweiger to produce the first New Year&#39; s baby to walk away with 25 thousand, engaging the help of Carla Gugino&#39; s spiritual doctor. <br/><br/>Leaving the hospital and into the hottest party in town, there&#39; s food caterer Laura (Katherine Heigl) who has to contend with rock star Jensen (Jon Bon Jovi) who is trying his utmost to win her back after walking out on her a year ago, with tired comedy contributed by her chefs played by Sofia Vergara and Russell Peters. Jensen&#39; s backup singer Elise (Lea Michele) finds herself stuck in a lift with the indifferent Randy (Ashton Kutcher) while en route to the performance. Sarah Jessica Parker and Abigail Breslin play a protective mother and daughter pair where the latter is trying to seek permission to spend the night out with her friends. Hillary Swank plays the executive of the ball drop event which has hit a snag, with Ludicrous as her police confidante, and rounding it all up is Josh Duhamel as a music mogul apprehensive whether he&#39; ll meet the woman of his dreams once more. <br/><br/>And throw in a couple more big names from Ryan Seacrest to cameos like Matthew Broderick and even Michael Bloomberg himself against the backdrop of Times Square, and the stage&#39; s all set for one heck of a party, not. Most of the stories here, written by Katherine Fugate, seemed more like an exercise to pack as many characters as possible without digging deeper in to the emotions on why such a day on the calendar is such a big deal. While Valentine&#39; s Day may have it easier since any romantic tale will fit the bill, how do you do one for New Year&#39; s, and to do so successfully, and convincingly? If not for the bevy of stars, this film would have fallen flat on its face because there&#39; s nothing absolutely compelling in the stories that you&#39; d root for anyone to succeed in fulfilling their objectives before the new year kicks in. <br/><br/>It&#39; s dull and uninspiring, with no real emotion on display despite the wealth of talent at its disposal. The one I really wanted to laugh out loud at, is that of the Josh Duhamel arc involving a guy pining for a woman whom he had described a magical meeting that got etched permanently in his mind. This served as the hook to engage until the end, but what an anti-climatic let down when the identity got revealed, because throughout the film every other female character was of a lot more positive in attitude that the final chosen one, and worse, seemed to be forced into it because her character arc was simply the most atrocious of the lot. I never understood her appeal, and when she appeared in the end to close the loop, I&#39; d swear I&#39; d rather shoot myself if that was something that can happen in real life. <br/><br/>New Year&#39; s Eve was a tad too long in dragging out its scenes so that each arc has about an equal amount of time without one upstaging another, but all in all this film has one purpose and one purpose only - to serve as product placement, in almost every shot you&#39; d see a brand name sticking out. You&#39; d get a lot more cheer in actually getting outside and making merry with strangers, than to be stuck in a cinema hall watching this depressingly bad film. Pick something else instead if you crave for ensemble films. ",2
"I rather enjoy the odd ensemble comedy such as this film, I somewhat enjoyed Valentines Day and I really enjoyed He&#39; s Just Not That Into You, but what those film had but this doesn&#39; t is a fewer amount of plot lines. There&#39; s just too much going on in this film, far too many characters, as soon as I found myself interested in one plot its segment would end, you can never get really attached to one set of characters. <br/><br/>For me the best storyline was the Michelle Pfieffer and Zefron plot, it was really the only one with a bit of substance, I actually think a full movie of that story would be great, also the Jessica Biel and Seth Meyers plot was rather funny thanks to the highly underrated Ms Biel. This movie is entertaining enough I suppose but it&#39; s also lacking any real great laugh out loud moments, the only time I laughed was when Jessica Biel was in labour, she could do some great comedy if given the chance. <br/><br/>Lea Michele manages to bring her great screen charisma to the big screen, she is very fun to watch and her rendition of Aude Lang Syne was lovely and a nice way to end the movie. <br/><br/>If this movie had about four or five less stories happening this movie would have been much better, it&#39; s not horrible by any standards but it&#39; s not excellent either, also this may sound mean but Sofia Vergara is possibly the most annoying actress alive, at least they didn&#39; t put a decent actress in the most annoying role in the film. I mean it&#39; s worth paying to see the excellent dance scene between Zefron and Pfieffer over the end credits. <br/><br/>OK, but basically it&#39; s exactly the same as Valentines Day but with more actors and a lot less substance. <br/><br/>Enjoy. Maybe. ",4
"I wanted to give this film 1 out of 10, but there was a single poignant scene starring Halle Berry that provided the only depth of character in the entire film. <br/><br/>Otherwise, this movie is a disaster. The storyline is obvious and pathetic, the characters are so weak that you don&#39; t feel any sympathy for their respective plights, and the film lacks any sense of being genuine. <br/><br/>I just wanted it to end, and spent much of the time rolling my eyes with disbelief that actors as strong as this ensemble cast had been presented with such dreadful dialogue and such weak characters. <br/><br/>This film made Valentine&#39; s Day look good (an incredible feat) and both films were clearly an attempt at an American version of Love Actually, which both utterly failed. <br/><br/>Don&#39; t waste 2 hours of your life on this drivel.

"For the first time ever I have been forced to write a review about a movie, because I don&#39; t want everyone to spend money of this diabolical piece of work. <br/><br/>What a waste of a superb cast. There is not ONE redeeming feature of this movie. Total waste of my time just to get to the theatre to watch it. I was gone after an excruciating 40 minutes. Don&#39; t let the big names fool you. They are ALL way off the mark, but that is to be expected with such a bad script and, oh God, where was the director?. <br/><br/>A big red light and a solid warning. . give this a huge miss. If it was free- to-air I&#39; d still change channel. ",1
"Full of names, names and more names. I expected to be disappointed but it was oh, so much more. <br/><br/>A movie NOT worth watching, not even for free on the TV, unless you think drinking castor oil might be fun. Made me wonder how all those names ever made a name. <br/><br/>Bad writing, casting, acting, directing, editing. APPALLING movie, worse than porn, amusing only in its appalling-ness . . . and all those big names being appalling, some by association, some just because they are Sarah Jessica Parker. My god, that woman should move to the south pole and stay there. Can&#39; t believe someone thought it would be a good idea to let her breed . . . ",1
"Incredible bad movie, maybe the worst I have ever seen. Full of stereotypes, without a story. Just a bunch of known actors thrown in the worst script that ever came to screen (this is why I was fooled). If half of those actors would be put in any other script, it certainly would be better than this communist story. There is absolutely nothing to watch. Predictable, lazy, without sense, no surprises, no logic, no idea, no sense again. No atmosphere, stupid subjects, and the worst predictable stereotypes, with every single occasion. Do not waste your time, I just did that and I am so sorry. To the producers: Why is this a comedy? Because you laugh at me for being so fool thinking that a movie with De Niro should be at least good? To the actors: Do not ever agree to work on such a movie again. I believed in your names to offer me a nice evening. Next time, I will think twice before trusting in you as professionals. I will wait for other&#39; s reviews, and only if it is satisfactory I will buy a ticket. Sorry for you because you have missed a opportunity to do something Artistic, to be Proffesisionals. ",1
"I&#39; m reading some bad reviews of this movie, and I don&#39; t think the criticisms are exactly justified. While many of the complaints are valid, I don&#39; t think they apply to a movie like this. <br/><br/>I saw Hugo and loved it. That movie is &quot; art&quot; in it&#39; s most beautiful form. I expected it to be. Hugo is caviar from Le Bernardin. <br/><br/>New Year&#39; s Eve is a big, sloppy, tasty chocolate fudge milkshake from Baskin Robbins. It isn&#39; t classy. It doesn&#39; t take a lot of talent to make it. But it is ultimately satisfying and puts a smile on your face. My daughter and I both really enjoyed New Year&#39; s Eve. For the first few minutes, we did feel a bit like we had ADD because the scenes changed so quickly from one story line to the next. But we soon got into the pace of it and enjoyed it thoroughly as a happy diversion on a Saturday afternoon. It&#39; s much better than last Year&#39; s Valentines Day and is definitely a feel-good movie for a Girls&#39; Night Out. ",8
"This may quite possibly be the worst movie ever made. The only thing that&#39; s remarkable about this film is how anyone got so many famous actors that aren&#39; t cheap, to make this movie. I&#39; m sure they pitched it as &quot; Love Actually meets New York on New Year&#39; s Eve&quot; or something stupid like that. Whomever got this movie made must be a great sales person because this movie is just one big piece of crap! There is nothing redeeming about it at all. The couples aren&#39; t believable and more importantly, I didn&#39; t care about them at all. There was no build up to believable chemistry. We were just supposed to take it on faith. Don&#39; t waste your time on this one!",1
"Do NOT bother with this over-budgeted, poorly-written, over-acted, hammy waste of film stock. This movie was so bad it made me long for infinitely better movies like Barney&#39; s Great Adventure and Ed (note sarcasm). <br/><br/>Too many story lines (if you can even call them that)+too many stars=a complete crap fest. <br/><br/>I thought Zac Efron was terrible (not sure it was his acting more than it was the awful lines that were written for him). Michelle Pfeiffer (who is usually smoking hot) looked absolutely awful (I&#39; m thinking this was on purpose since her character was basically worn out with life in general). Completely forgettable performances by all involved (would give Hector Elizondo a pass but his accent was a miss). <br/><br/>I usually like Gary Marshall films, but this one was a &quot; worthless steaming pile of cow dung. . . figuratively speaking. &quot; <br/><br/>To sum up--other than the gratuitous shots of NYC, this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.

"It&#39; s quite disconcerting when people in the theater laugh at something you&#39; re SUPPOSED to laugh at - even if it isn&#39; t funny. That&#39; s the way I felt during the entire two-hour running time of Garry Marshall&#39; s &quot; New Year Eve, &quot; his superior sequel to 2010&#39; s &quot; Valentine&#39; s Day&quot; (though that isn&#39; t saying very much). <br/><br/>I don&#39; t know, maybe this long-winded and convoluted tale of the loves and lives of 20-plus individuals on the last day of 2011 was hilarious at its core, but being the Philistine that I am, maybe I just did not get the humor. <br/><br/>As it was, &quot; New Year&#39; s Eve, &quot; as a &quot; star-packed&quot; film, is nowhere near as funny as say, &quot; Grand Canyon, &quot; &quot; Bobby&quot; or &quot; Magnolia, &quot; but was certainly a better comedy than &quot; The Hangover 2&quot; (but, then again, most memorial services rate in that department). <br/><br/>Film stars - in no particular order of talent or popularity - Michelle Pfeiffer, Zac Efron, Halle Berry, Alyssa Milano, Cary Elwes, Ashton Kutcher, Seth Meyers, Jessica Beal, Chris &quot; Ludicris&quot; Bridges, Common, Hilary Swank, Jon Bon Jovi, Katherine Heigl, Til Schweiger, James Belushi, Ryan Seacrest, Hector Elizondo, Josh Duhamel, John Lithgow, Abigail Breslin, Yeardly Smith, Larry Miller, Leah Michele, Sarah Paulson, Sofia Vergara, Penny Marshall, Matthew Broderick and, unfortunately, Robert De Niro. <br/><br/>Oh, and before you think that&#39; s the end of the pain, the film also features Sarah Jessica Parker, fresh off of three straight failures, &quot; Sex and the City, &quot; parts 1 and 2, as well as &quot; How Does She Do It?&quot; The so-called plot is wrapped around the lowering of the ball in New York&#39; s Times Square and has Claire (Swank) in charge of the proceedings with NYPD officer Brendon (Bridges) as her personal bodyguard. <br/><br/>Other confusing story lines include super chef Laura (Heigl) hooking up with rock star Jensen (Bon Jovi) - while Vergara does an embarrassing Latina stereotype, record executive Sam (Duhamel) trapped with a backwoods family in an RV, Kim (Parker) fighting with teen daughter Hailey (Breslin), Stan Harris (De Niro) dying in a hospital and being cared for by Aimee (Berry), New Year&#39; s Eve-hating Randy (Kutcher) stuck in an elevator with Jensen&#39; s backup singer Elise (Michele), while couples Griffin and Tess Byrne (Meyers and Biel) and James and Grace Schwab (Schweiger and Paulson) battle to see who will have the first New Year&#39; s baby in New York. <br/><br/>And hovering above all of this is bicycle messenger Paul (Efron) trying to fulfill all the ridiculous wishes of wallflower Ingrid (Pfeiffer, think &quot; The Bucket List&quot; without the laughs), most of which seem impossible to achieve, including a trip to Bali, saving a life and performing at Radio City Music Hall. Not bad for a bicycle messenger (that&#39; s Hollywood for you). <br/><br/>Alas, whereas unlike &quot; Bobby, &quot; there is no Sirhan Sirhan to show up and herald the end of the misery. Here, we get resolutions made, broken and then realized, loose ends neatly tied and lost love regained. <br/><br/>It&#39; s a valiant effort by Marshall (who helmed &quot; Happy Days&quot; and went on to direct such feature films as &quot; Pretty Woman, &quot; &quot; Princess Diaries&quot; and &quot; Runaway Bride, &quot; among others), but with little or no character development, the confusion is so thick here, and plot lines are crossing back-and-forth so much it seems more like a train wreck. <br/><br/>A sad, but more than adequate description of this motion picture.

"I&#39; m going to be honest. I liked Valentine&#39; s Day. Sure, it was as predictable as the UK Christmas No. 1, but it was cute and cheesy and sweet and your typical fluffy Valentine&#39; s Day movie. But first of all. What is a New Year&#39; s Eve movie? Seriously, who came up with the idea of a movie about New Year&#39; s Eve? New Year&#39; s Eve is pretty much a night where teenagers and young adults go to parties and make out, families go to awkward parties at Aunt Pamela&#39; s, there&#39; s a big countdown, but it&#39; s not that big a deal. New Year&#39; s Eve is a celebration of the upcoming year, and apart from a speech by Hilary Swank&#39; s character, they don&#39; t even touch on that. So the story is about ten or fifteen people who are somehow linked together. We don&#39; t know how or why, and by half way, I just wanted it to end. They all play the most ridiculous, under-developed, bland characters, who lead into a story but then stop to make room for another half-hearted character. The actors- most of them past their sell-by date, like Kutcher, Biel, Heigl- just prove why they&#39; re in this attention-seeking, made purely for money movie instead of something with depth. To be honest, I&#39; m disappointed in Abigail Breslin and Jake T. Austin, who actually show promise. They&#39; re also incredibly annoying, especially Sarah Jessica Parker&#39; s character. I don&#39; t even know her name, do they even mention it? And Heigl&#39; s character manages another scene stuffing her face, you just want to punch Bon Jovi for being so annoying, and Sofia Vegara, who is hilarious in Modern Family, seems to be the only hum-our there, and even those jokes are straight out of her Modern Family character, Gloria. It&#39; s an hour and a half of awkward kisses, guys getting off with fifty year old women, stories being abandoned half way and celebrities who have, now, hit rock bottom. This probably was the worst movie I have ever watched. ",1
"NEW YEAR&#39; S EVE falls into that class of films best labeled &#39; cute&#39; . Lots of stories, most of little consequence, an attempt to pull everything together with the premise that new Year&#39; s Eve gives everyone a chance to make things different in the following year (the New Year&#39; s Resolution carried to the extreme), some funny jokes pushed over the edge toward silly, and a script full of holes. But the bouncing around from micro story to micro story works OK because it gives the actors involved a chance to come on set for a day or two of work and leave unstressed and financially healthy. Katherine Fugate wrote the stewed ingredient stories for Garry Marshall to stir, and the list of actors involved is staggering: Michelle Pfeiffer, Zac Efron, Robert De Niro, Halle Berry, Cary Elwes, Jessica Biel, Seth Meyers , Sarah Paulson, Til Schweiger, Carla Gugino, Katherine Heigl, Jon Bon Jovi, Sofía Vergara, Ashton Kutcher, Lea Michele, Sarah Jessica Parker, Abigail Breslin, Josh Duhamel, Larry Miller, Penny Marshall, Cherry Jones, Hilary Swank, Ludicrous, Hector Elizondo, Ryan Seacrest, Matthew Broderick, John Lithgow and more. <br/><br/>This is a razzle dazzle movie with some good moments, improbable though they mostly are, and a nice mindless evening to enjoy popcorn. Enter with low expectations and take it for what it is - entertainment. <br/><br/>Grady Harp",5
"Words can&#39; t describe how terrible this &quot; Film&quot; was. . But I will try. I would give it minus 10 if I could but unfortunately 1 is the lowest score. <br/><br/>I like a light hearted laugh as much as the next person but the only time i even cracked a smile was when i was laughing at myself out of sheer embarrassment for sitting through it. <br/><br/>Its quite hard to believe that something with this many poorly written story lines, lack of decent acting and substance, could be enjoyed by anyone who hasn&#39; t had their lower frontal lobes removed. <br/><br/>How any of the staff or cast involved could be proud of creating such a monstrosity, is beyond belief. <br/><br/>Its basically every poorly executed cliché imaginable, rolled up into a hundred and eighteen minute long ball of snot. . . <br/><br/>Avoid.

"Why does everyone have to look at every movie with an oh so critical and cynical eye?<br/><br/>This is a great seasonal movie to go and take your family (I did yesterday) in amongst all the pre-Christmas madness and just sit down, take a load off, relax, smile and enjoy. . . Sure it&#39; s no Citizen Kane. . but it never purported to be!<br/><br/>It&#39; s a nice feel-good movie<br/><br/>so go and take off the cynical glasses and enjoy. . we wouldn&#39; t enjoy half of great Christmas movies if we all took this jaded view of movies!",8
"i think i may have read this somewhere before, but the ONLY good thing about this movie is the knowledge that if GARBAGE like this can be made into a movie, then the crap i write can too. this movie is absolutely PUTRID (in caps) whoever wrote this script needs to be congratulated. . . they are blowing the right person/people. . . it takes talent to get a great script made into a movie but it takes absolute genius to get a piece of crap script made into a movie! MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! and to echo previous posts, i am amazed that half the cast actually agreed to be a part of this pile of donkey sh*t. astounding! i need to hire this whole crew to do something really meaningful. miracles do occur.

"Just read the headline. There is way to much going on in this movie to even understand what is going on! The idea of making a movie like this is good, just like valentines day. The problem with these movies is that yes they sign a lot and i mean A lot of big name actors, even 3 Oscar winners like, swank, De Niro, and Berry. The problem with this is that you don&#39; t know who to focus on. The scenarios are thrown in and out and shuffled around like a high stakes poker deck, its just unbearable! About 30 Min&#39; s in and I&#39; m totally lost with the plot. It made me want to see breaking dawn, YES i said it, I&#39; m a 21 year old guy who would rather see twilight then this garbage, at least i know what is going on in twilight and I&#39; m not clueless the whole time i was watching it. Trust me people wait for the girl with the dragon tattoo or some other Oscar movie cause trust me this will be 118 Min&#39; s of your life that you save by watching something else!",1
"Where to begin? Okay, it was awful. <br/><br/>What I immediately noticed was this thing was pieced together very badly. It wasn&#39; t cut away with a &#39; meanwhile&#39; feel to it, suddenly we would just see someone again (I noticed how badly it was done when it cut from Phieffer and Efron, goes to someone else, then falls back to Phieffer and Efron, then off again). <br/><br/>Catch a two-part Love Boat episode and see how well it goes from story to story. <br/><br/>And are these all the jobs for women? Swank is oveseeing the New Year&#39; s celebration (definitely straining to channel Maureen O&#39; Hara from Miracle on 34th St), this woman Hiegl was it, the caterer, and then Sarah JP as some flashlighted dress designer. Looked more like a seamstress to me. They all seemed to be channeling the same &#39; Im a professional woman&#39; image. <br/><br/>I think the funniest bit was that all of America, no, the WORLD is going to be watching NYC on New Year&#39; s Eve. <br/><br/>Uh, hello? Never heard of time zones? It was probably what? Nine or ten in the morning where Halle Berry&#39; s man was stationed. Who watches celebrations in NY? NY is probably the fourth-to-the-last time zone to celebrate the new year, towards the end. So why would the WORLD be watching what is going on in NY? And Swank&#39; s speech sucked. <br/><br/>Sometimes it felt like I was watching a Happy Days or Laverne &amp; Shirley marathon, with pregnant women and trapped in elevators. <br/><br/>One bit I did notice, Seth Meyers&#39; wife pushed on the belly a bit too much, clearly displaying it wasn&#39; t a baby. <br/><br/>And is this New York? A race to see who has the first baby of the year? As I said, check out a couple of eps of Love Boat, or better yet still, look for a TV movie called Last American Traffic Jame (retitled on IMDb as Gridlock) for an idea of how overlapping, inter-twining stories can be sorted out and placed with characters interacting. It can be done. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, New Years Eve wasn&#39; t it. ",1
"I watched the first
 episode and cried and felt wonderful when it was over. I believe that 
is the definition of a ""feel-good"" story. I watched the second one and 
now I want to take some time and think about what I've seen and how 
great the performances are and I want to call my adult daughters and 
tell them about it and have them watch so we can fan-girl about it.
I want to curl up on a cozy couch with a fluffy blanket and cup of tea 
and box of tissues on a cold afternoon and watch the next episode.
It's unexpected, it doesn't follow the path you expect and best of all, 
it's a master class in subtle, nuanced acting. ",10
"Stuck in bed sick and have binge watched the whole season. I cried, I laughed, I felt all the things. Fully recommend. ",10
"I went into this 
with a big old chip on my shoulder. I hate the ""Love Actually"" 
contrived, everyone is connected in some way storyline. I find it 
painful. But I had gotten tired of streaming dark British crime dramas 
and gave it a shot. I almost turned it off in the first ten minutes. 
Really? They are going to start the series with a lot of actors we've 
never seen. And then the magic happened. It stopped seeming contrived 
and became lovely. The characters were good people and I wanted them to 
be happy. No Hallmark moronic misunderstandings. It's not all hearts and
 flowers, and I have only seen two episodes, but it made me emotional 
and happy in a way TV seldom does. 30 minutes is too 
short. . . . . . . . . . . . and just right. ",9
"I've only watched 
the first three episodes so far, but this show really surprised me. The 
storytelling and casting is fantastic! I love that they're all 
standalone stories. . . too good to binge watch! I feel like I need to 
soak each one in!",10
"A simple and 
flawless ""love"" story delivered in the customary three part formula at 
an unhurried pace and featuring a pretty accurately depicted cast of

actions, just as we would like it to be if this were our story, right?",10

watch a new show that is truly just heartwarming. Each episode had me so
 emotionally invested in such a short amount of time. So nice to finally
 watch a show were you don't have to expect a sad or miserable le ending

made my heart truly happy &amp; the way every episode came together in 
the end was so beautiful. ",10
Right amount of warmth this fall needs. Appreciate every perspective of love!,8

 episodes were definitely worth and hour and a half of your life. Very

"Being a cynic of 
love, I had doubts. But it's a rainy day looking for something 
different, and I wanted to wander from my Always Sunny/Fleabag type 
shows I love so much.   It's an unexpected view on love, not just 
romance. The first episode was around a 6 or 7 for me, but as I 
continued watching I felt more connected to the overall tone. These were
 stories of just life happening. It wasn't too sugary or sweet, just 
real.   I have to add, the one with Anne Hathaway started out 
cheesy but turned out to be probably my 2nd favorite. If you struggle 
with emotional issues or depression, you'll be glad that story was told!  Why only 9 out of 10? Well, you can't change a cynic in one day. : )",9
"Each and every episode I found a part of myself, I can only hope that you feel that way also.
It was an emotional and wonderful way of story telling, I felt like a child again discovering something new.
For me in these troubled times it was an experience that touched my heart in every way it can possibly be felt.
All of the casting was incredible, I just can't say enough about how this series has impacted my life. ",10
"The Catherine 
Keener/ Dev Patel story was my favorite. The Doorman episode was very 
moving. The Tina Fey/ John Slattery was horrible, which was 
disappointing as I love these actors.   Ann Hathaway depicting 
mental illness through song and dance was very interesting. How she 
finally talks about what is happening to her with her friend was great.   The episode with the young woman with daddy issues was squirmy uncomfortable.   And
 they saved the best for last. The wonderful Jane Alexander and finding 
love for those of us "" of a certain age "" was life affirming.   Loved how they tied up all the episodes at the end. ",8
"I've listened to 
the podcast and knew right away I wanted to watch this. In a way, it's 
like Love Actually but a million times . . . . better. Love comes in all 
forms in life and these stories are written by real people who want to 
express the love they've experienced, not just in a traditional sense.   Beautifully
 done, emotional, and there isn't many shows about ""love"" that I really 
care for. But this one is very real to me. Love in snippets, meaningful 
gestures, and caring about someone and showing them. ",9
"This is a brilliant
 show. Loved it watched it in two evenings. I really like how they 
puzzled together all kind of love, friendships and relationships from 
different aspects. Really well made and I loved how they end it and 
joined all together in a last episode. ",9
"Went into it expecting it to be bad, but was pleasantly surprised, doesn't try to hard and every episode is delightful. ",9
"I loved it! Sweet, 
romantic, quirky, and painful at times. Just like in real life. Bonuses 
are the amazing cast, and based on real life stories. ",9
One of the most beautiful thing I've ever watched!,10

good! Each time, the stories had different topics and got better and 
better. And they do so well to show you the different variations of 
love. Pulled my heart strings every time. ",10

"I went to see this film with my sister and my Mum and we were the only ones in the cinema. Not the best start, but I continued to watch it anyway and am so glad I did. This is probably one of the most beautiful and romantic films I have ever seen! From the relationship of the two characters to their surroundings, every scene is breathtaking! The Notebook tells the story of a summer romance that turns into a romance never to be forgotten. Allie and Noah are the two lead characters and they are wonderful. You immediately fall in love with the characters and you want to follow every step of their doomed love story. it is one of the greatest love stories ever told. Look out for the lake scene, unbelievable! I came out of the cinema wanting to go back in again and watch it all over again. It feels like you are reading a diary watching this film, thats how detailed and wonderful this film is. Cannot really give too much away about the story, all I can say is if you haven&#39; t seen this film yet, be sure to see it. I cannot think of a film more perfect for Valentines Day!",10
"This movie seems to be postcard perfect, a lesson straight out of the director&#39; s guide to romantic movies. Boy meets girl at a carnival, love from the other side of the tracks, a date by the water, etc. And yet the wonderful thing about this movie is that it takes what seems like a story you&#39; ve heard already (at least in bits and pieces) and still moves you deeply. It really speaks about love in a way that most romantic movies miss by speaking in cliché or over shoot by adding in numerous complications to dramatize things. There have been other great movies to comment on love in recent years (Eternal Sunshine, Lost In Translation jump to mind) but this movie fills a need that those other movies miss: the need for a straight, sweep you off your feet romance. Too bad there can&#39; t be movies like this every year. . . ",10
"Often times when a movie comes from source material such as a novel that did well, the people who were fans of the book end up not liking the movie as much. Sometimes those same fans even end up hating the movie, or not even giving it a chance by seeing it. Such was the case, that I already knew the ending of Nicholas Sparks&#39; s novel even before I got into the theater. Let me clear up though, that the best thing about the film was that I ended up getting wrapped in the story on the screen, rather than sitting there thinking to myself what part of the story should be coming next. That is what makes a great adaptation, when you can get lost in the story, and forget about your thoughts, or what is going on in the outside world. Not only that, but the film soared past any expectations that I had for it from the start too, by being very well Directed and acted. <br/><br/>Best known for his acting credits, Nick Cassavetes was tapped to direct this film. His past experience, which didn&#39; t consist of very many films includes the Denzel Washington film John Q. This was not going to be an easy task for him though, because the story was built on us believing the love that the main characters of the film would be showing was real. It?s not as easy as it sounds, and some films (like Star Wars Part 2), end up making the audience laugh, rather than feel what the characters are feeling. He did a great job, and helped put together a great cast for this film that would end up including Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner, and Joan Allen. All actors who have found their niches before, and were brought in to this film to help carry the story. <br/><br/>Gosling is best known for his role as &quot; Richie&quot; , one of the kids, in Murder By Numbers. He brings a great innocence to the role of Noah Calhoun in the film, one of the two main characters. Rachel McAdams plays the other half of the duo as Allie Hamilton. She was actually one of the leads (Regina George) in an earlier Summer movie, Mean Girls. At the heart of this film the couple represents the love story that is being told by James Garner&#39; s character. He reads from a book , the story of the two lovers as they go through everything life has to offer. Gena Rowlands plays the lady that he is reading to, and she gets as wrapped up in the story as we do, as he progresses from chapter to chapter in the novel he is reading. Garner was perfect for this role, and shows his narrating skills as he explains how the two of them live. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the story, Noah and Allie meet in one of the cutest scenes of the movie. He sees her at a carnival, and knows right away that he wants to be with her. He does not know quite why at first, and all he can say is that something inside of him is drawing him to her. He convinces her to give him a chance, and she eventually agrees to give him the date that he seeks. What progresses from there is a Summer romance that goes through all of the emotions that we all have experienced before. What makes it even more real, is that it is not played off as if every single moment is perfect between the two of them. It depicts that they do have fights, that they do have disagreements, but that they do have a love that is stronger than any of that. This is what made the romance real for me. Everyone knows, that in real life we can&#39; t have a relationship where everything works out perfectly, or where everyone agrees on everything. <br/><br/>The romance blossoms, but a problem exists that could spell trouble. Noah is from a one- parent family, and sees himself working at a lumber-yard for the better part of his life. He says that he has found his place in life, and this is what the &quot; cards&quot; have planned for him. Allie on the other hand, come from a very well-off family, and is being brought up in a rich societal circle. Her family is spending her 17th Summer in the small town by the sea, and first comes across Noah by pure coincidence. The romance between them is kept under wraps for quite a while, until her parents find out. The mother immediately thinks that is should end, but the father feels that it is just a summer &quot; thing&quot; that will come to an end rather quickly. That is, until she is out late one night with Noah, and he takes the side of his wife. They see no future between their daughter and this &quot; boy&quot; , and take her away from him the first chance they get. <br/><br/>That coupled with the outbreak of World War II keeps them apart for a couple of years, and the story really gets underway. Will their love be able to endure the separation, or will one of them move on to something that is easier in their own lives? The story becomes an epic of its own, as its starts to split time between the story being read, and the story of Garner and Rowlands living in the present day. This is what I love about films like these, as we are given the opportunity to enjoy two different stories going on at the same time. The love shown by Noah and Allie is something that envelopes us, and it makes us forget about the current story. By going back and forth, we are able to look forward to where each of the two stories is going. All of it leads to an ending of each story that is both very enjoyable, and very emotional at the same time. <br/><br/>As I said before, sometimes a book can fail to transition to film. This is not one of those cases, as the movie instead becomes its own entity. Both stories have great chemistry between the characters at the center of them. It is amazing just how well the actors/actresses in the parts play their roles, and just how much we as an audience start to care about their lives. As it progresses, we truly care about what will happen to the main characters, and we have in our own minds how we want things to turn out. It is that type of film, where we start to become part of the story, and want them to act or say something specific, that truly makes a great story. Even though this is a movie that is heavily geared to lovers of romance novels, this is a film that I found very enjoyable. I highly recommend seeing this film while it is in theaters, or purchasing it when it hits DVD, because it has everything that is needed for a truly great love story. ",10
"This amazing love story can be enjoyed by all. The Notebook is not one of those cheesy chick flicks that often come out, it is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to. <br/><br/>Even most males will agree that this movie pulls at your heart strings. Filled with fabulous quotes, and sentimental moments I found this movie to be one of the best I&#39; ve seen. I got to know both main characters and found myself relating to each of them. Most of us remember our first love and that strong connection we had with them. This movie makes us think of what could have been and gives us a fresh look at the meaning of true love. I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart. ",10
"I went into this movie with the misconception of thinking this was just another typical romantic movie, but I was very impressed by this film and the themes portrayed in this movie were handled in a great way. <br/><br/>This movie will have you feeling happy and joyful and the scenery is just brilliant. You will feel like you are part of the characters, and you will care about them throughout the whole movie. <br/><br/>The movie gallops in speed as we are absorbed into the great plot and brilliant acting of all the cast involved. Ryan Gosling is brilliant as the shy and quiet Noah, and Rachael McAdams is superbly beautiful as the star of the movie, Allie. <br/><br/>As I said earlier in my review, I did go into the movie not expecting much and that was because I thought it was a typical &quot; boy loves girl&quot; movie which are sometimes just too predictable. Don&#39; t get me wrong, they are some good Romantic movies that pull it off very well, but there are simply too many in that particular genre. <br/><br/>The best thing about this movie was the depth of the plot and the actors playing their characters so well. The supporting cast were good, and James Marsden deserves a mention for managing to pull of a hard role as the &quot; rich man&quot; well. Another plus point about this movie was the great script, and you did not see too many &quot; cliches&quot; which is always a good sign in a Romance movie. <br/><br/>It does not matter whether you love romantic movies or hate them, this is NOT just a romantic movie it is so more than that. By the end of the movie you will feel a whole heap of emotions. You will be talking about this movie for a long time. <br/><br/>The only bad part about this movie is the length, which I think could be shortened a bit but on the whole this was a superb movie which is well worth a watch. <br/><br/>Go and Watch this! Amazing movie which will have you brimming with joy. <br/><br/>9 1/2 out of 10",10
"This story plays out as Duke, played by James Garner, reads a story about two young people in the 1940s who fall in love and endure life. The movie moves between present-day and the 1940s. It is structurally very similar to &quot; Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; , which is also one of my all time favorite movies. <br/><br/>Unlike &quot; Fried Green Tomatoes&quot; , this focuses on young love as it grows and endures through wars and parental dissent. Sure, the core is the &quot; Romeo and Juilet&quot; theme, but the way is plays out and the exceptional charisma that the actors bring to the screen make it feel fresh and not entirely predictable. This is a deeply romantic movie. If you are cynical at all about romance, timeless love and dedication to another person, you may find yourself rolling your eyes a bit. I am not that cynical about the emotional ties that bind us and I was thoroughly taken in by the story. <br/><br/>This is such a gentle movie. The characters are very human and very likable. All of the actors turn in engrossing and compelling performances. <br/><br/>Technically, this movie is exceptional, too. The scenes during the opening credits is absolutely breathtaking. The editing is very good. The story is compelling from the opening credits to the closing credits. <br/><br/>My wife and I don&#39; t always share the same perspective on movies, but we agreed on this one. We both loved it immensely. I am certain this will become part of our permanent collection. ",10
"The Notebook is one of my all-time favourite movies. Its a constant, and classic love story that makes you feel as if you are there watching it. . as if you are one of the characters, which makes the impact of the story just that much more real. There really are no words to describe how this movie makes you feel, but one thing is for sure. . . It will make you feel. After watching it, i&#39; ve often just. . sat where i am and just thought about it. It&#39; s just one of those movies that you will think about 30 years after watching it, and still get that same feeling in your heart. . and you&#39; ll know that it touched you in one way or another. If you haven&#39; t seen it, you really are missing out. . . Its a classic!",10
"I am a big fan of love stories. Lately, the film industry has been lacking the sort of element that I love to see in a movie. The last movie I saw that made me cry as much as &quot; The Notebook&quot; did was &quot; Ghost&quot; with Demi Moore. The casting of Allie and Noah in the movie was exceptional and made the feelings and emotions seem real. After watching the movie in the theater, I noticed every person, including the men, cry as they left the theater. Now when was the last time you saw anything like that?? I bought the movie on DVD the day it came out and have been watching it everday since that day!! I would highly recommend this movie to both males and females. ",10
"I don&#39; t understand why anything happens in this movie. I don&#39; t understand why he fell in love with her just like that and why, all of the the sudden, she was interested too I don&#39; t understand why he goes to war and why his friends dies and she becomes a nurse, nor how that adds to the story And the only reason I see for his father to die is so she can conveniently go to his house and have sex without anyone bothering You won&#39; t see any character evolution. He will always be the simplistic, loyal, romantic nice guy, and she will be the noisy spoiled girl that never made any decision in her life. And they will always love each other, no matter what happened to them. Also, the old couple bits thrown in the middle were a bit unnecessary in my opinion. You could tell right away where they were going with it, which ruins that mind blowing ending they were trying to go for. They could have easily created a cute romantic ending in a more unexpected way. ",4
"I hesitated to watch this movie for almost 2 years until I got into the Netflix club and saw a little of the movie. I then couldn&#39; t wait to receive it by mail but instead, I ran out to the Video store and rented it. It was only a dollar to rent but I can sure say one thing. It was the best dollar that I ever spent. I never had a movie that moved me nor made me shed so many tears and as soon as my wife came in from shoping, I told her that its a must see movie and then started to tell her the who story. Before you knew it, I was at the end and still crying. I am one of those guys that don&#39; t easily get moved by movies but this one got to me. Don&#39; t get me wrong, It was tears of joy with a little taste of sorrow all thru out. <br/><br/>You will love it! I promise. ",10
"Although they&#39; re fun to watch, most love movies are predictable after seeing the first five minutes. The Notebook, however; keeps you glued to the t. v and guessing. Rachel Mcadams&#39; character is a more sweet and disciplined rich girl who she plays beautifully. Ryan Gosiling also brings out the best in his character and together they make the perfect couple. I&#39; m not much of a romantic, but the scenes of them together are really not easy to put into words. All i can say is that, if you&#39; re a love movie person, it&#39; s the movie for you. And if you&#39; re not, it&#39; s still the movie for you, to make you realise not all love movies are the same. ",9
"This was one of the greatest love stories that I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Ryan Gosling was, as always, authentic in his portrayal of Noah, a poor working class guy who falls in love with Allie, a beautiful rich girl who is staying in town with her family on their summer&#39; s vacation. The relationship is not well received by Allie&#39; s parents which leads Noah to make a decision that he feels is in both of their best interests. The result of a hastily made decision leads our main character down a road that first shuts out true passion as he tries to forget his past hurt. But, a stint in the military, where he experiences loss as well as his loss at home following his service in the military, leads him right back to his heart. The story is deep and bittersweet, but ultimately rewarding. It doesn&#39; t get any better than this. Wow!",10
"I must stress to you my belief in that the &#39; romantic comedy&#39; is pretty much the worst creation of mankind. Some may argue that religion or the atom bomb are more destructive but the romcom (ugh!) is consistent proof that the public are idiots willing to fork over cash multiple times for the same old, same old crap. We very rarely get a sincere romance film, they kinda died out in the forties and have struggled for breath since. <br/><br/>I liked A Walk to Remember a lot and felt obliged to check this out (because it&#39; s from a book by the same writer). That obligation turned out to be quite rewarding as this sober, mature film was everything zillion dollar attempts to make us cry (I&#39; m subtly referencing Pearl Harbor) were not. It&#39; s all about character and the guts and imagination to tell a good story. <br/><br/>Noah is a simple 17-year-old lumberyard worker. He&#39; s cocky, arrogant but very good-natured and he quickly attaches himself to Allie, a girl from the city, from Old Money and a fussy family who condemn her relationship with Noah. This is all told in flashback as old Noah (James Garner) reads from his book of youthful memories. Yes, this part is nothing original but the conviction by the cast make it astonishingly real and believable. The performances all round (but especially from Gosling and Rachel McAdams) give The Notebook a strong edge over most attempts at romance. You can literally feel their urge for each other and are involved with them all the way. &#39; Will she or won&#39; t she&#39; plot lines have been done to agonising death so credit must be given Nick Cassavetes (who you&#39; ll probably best remember as Castor Troy&#39; s bald pal from Face/Off) for pulling it off so eloquently. <br/><br/>I strongly recommend that you give The Notebook a try. Even if your a hardened 300-pound muscle-man who&#39; s afraid to love it&#39; s still worth it. But I must warn you, if your the kind of person who breaks down in uncontrollable crying at the end of Bicentennial Man (err. . . ) you must know that The Notebook ends very similarly. So if your lip quivers easily, watch it alone. <br/><br/>The DVD is in gorgeous-looking 2. 35: 1 anamorphic widescreen that perfectly shows off the wonderful cinematography and warm color pallet of the film. The Dolby 5. 1 soundtrack is most unsophisticated but considering the nature of the film, that is to be expected. Extras include, 2 Commentaries by director Nick Cassavetes and writer Nicholas Sparks, 12 Deleted Scenes, featurettes on Cassavetes and Sparks, &#39; Locating The Notebook&#39; Featurette, Casting Noah and Allie Featurette, Rachel McAdams Screen Test and the Trailer.

"one of the worst films i have ever seen. poor script, corny, unpoetic, what more can you say? it had me laughing through this awful ordeal. anyone who liked this needs to go back to school. it is nothing more than a midday TV movie. very poor b-grade flick. pityful. weak. unimaginative. i have nothing but contempt for this poor excuse of a film. burn all the copies to wipe it from existence. please! if i could give it -10 i would. it doesn&#39; t take much to entertain some people. if you going to watch this for the first time just make sure you have a container to be sick into. you don&#39; t want to make a mess of your sofa. a disgrace. a blight in film history. a sickly corny pathetic, piece of rubbish.

"Outstanding! As predictable as the plot may appear, this is one of the greatest love stories ever told on the silver screen; it will melt the hardest of hearts. Don&#39; t bring a hankie, bring a towel. The screenplay as well as the adaptation portrayed by the actors was superb. This was not a movie on my RADAR at all; my wife selected it because she previously planned to read the book. What a wonderful surprise. I&#39; ve never formalized my opinion of a movie before, but I felt it was my duty this time around to include my comments in hopes it might influence someone else to see this wonderful movie. If you&#39; re in love, or looking for the definition of love, this is a must see movie!",10
"there are three things I look for in movies, quality acting, a good script, and originality of the story. . . this movie had none of these. Could it have been any more cliché? the only thing that impressed me was Allie&#39; s wardrobe and the car she was driving. I&#39; ve seen better acting on lifetime! and so many unnecessary parts that are completely pointless. &quot; A walk to remember&quot; is about a hundred times better and it didn&#39; t get half the attention this movie did. If you&#39; re not aware already, it&#39; s based on a book by the same author as &quot; the notebook&quot; . if you want to see a moving love story you&#39; ll be disappointed from this film unless you&#39; re 13. . . can&#39; t believe all the rave. . . it is not deserved. . . a total waste of my time. . . ",1
"It&#39; s not that I dislike romance anything but this has movie tries so hard to be some sort of acronym to the word &quot; chick flick&quot; that it ends up shooting you to death with it&#39; s intended love arrows. Now could it be that I can&#39; t relate the alleged lovers in this movie? I mean I wasn&#39; t born in the 30s, I&#39; m not a soldier so I was never in any wars (haven&#39; t we seen enough WW2 stories by the way?) and of course I don&#39; t have any family as of yet. But surely the universal power love is something everyone can relate to? Especially when depicted by a movie that uses no other element to drive its plot. Think again, the definition of love shown in this film is so naive, sugar-coated and completely oblivious of anything in the real world that it makes Star Wars look like something from the Discovery channel. <br/><br/>The so called &quot; couple&quot; in this film are only in love because the movie says they are, not because there&#39; s any sort of chemistry between the actors and not because the characters themselves even act like. Even Allie&#39; s alleged interest in painting felt so tacked on shallow and fake it made my head hurt. Speaking of Allie, it actually infuriates me to see the character acting like she has absolutely no control over her libido because the sex is just about the only thing the couple seems to have in common, and the only thing, aside from arguing, that they enjoy doing together. And yet this movie is supposed to be oh so romantic. <br/><br/>It&#39; s by some small miracle that this movie got the raving reviews it did, luckily it seems most of those were given by teenage girls and their tool boyfriends (no Oscars or anything) so I don&#39; t have to completely give up on humanity yet. If one day your girlfriend suddenly shows up all lyrical about this movie and wants it to &quot; share it with you&quot; I&#39; d strongly advise any guy to end that relationship pronto. Your girlfriend will obviously already have built up her own twisted fantasy of what a relationship should be like, a fantasy that no guy, live or dead, could possibly live up to. Stay away. ",1
"Why this movie is rated so high is beyond me. Don&#39; t get me wrong: I&#39; m a girl, love Ryan Gosling and was pretty much excited about watching the movie. Unfortunately, when this torture finally finished after two long and excruciating hours, I just couldn&#39; t help to think that this must&#39; ve been the corniest piece of trash in the history of movie making. The lead actors in my opinion had zero chemistry, and Ryan Gosling really disappointed me as Noah. The diversity of facial expressions was basically nonexistent and the acting was bad. And what&#39; s up with the character of Noah? Was he supposed to act and sound like a psycho? Cause if he was, they did a hell of a job. Rachel McAdams was really pretty, and that&#39; s basically it. And the ending. . . Oh, the ending! It was so lame and unrealistic it made me gag. What&#39; s heartbreaking and sad about it is a mystery to me. I don&#39; t know, maybe I just can&#39; t see the grandness of The Notebook, but I certainly don&#39; t wish to come across it again. ",1
"When they laid in the street to watch the lights change, I wanted an ice- cream truck to run them over. It&#39; s awful. Another poor-boy-meets rich-girl-and-her-parents-disapprove movie. If only Ryan Gosling&#39; s character had fallen from the carnival ride and she&#39; d married the carny dude who had been responsible for the Texas Chainsaw Massacre in nearby Lot 7 of the Paramount Studios, then we might have had a movie worth watching. What we need is more of the main characters in trite movies to turn into cybermen with secret yearnings to marry daleks. And they need to eat green jelly beans - a definite sign of a moral deficiency in any character, anywhere. ",1
"I can&#39; t believe someone agreed to make a film from this script. Everything is so blatantly obvious and no character goes through a journey. They are all one dimensional and boring. There is no suspension let alone any twists. <br/><br/>Saying all this, the photography is good and the acting isn&#39; t that bad. Still this doesn&#39; t warrant 2 stars. <br/><br/>Ah, yes, I&#39; ll just mention there are some uninspiring sex scenes and the film is also at least half an hour too long. <br/><br/>If you want to see a great love story where you feel with he characters and don&#39; t know why or how until the end, check The English Patient. ",1
"Most writers would sell out by repeatedly writing screenplays that are vastly different from one another. Take Christopher Nolan for example; going from a psychological thriller where the storyline is paced backwards to an Oscar-winning blockbuster in which a world renowned superhero faces off his arch nemesis. Talk about a lack of consistency. A true writer gracefully keeps revisiting the same story over and over and OVER again and a great example for that kind of writer is Nicholas Sparks. <br/><br/>If recycling is healthy for our environment, it has to be with movies too, right? Never before has this man forgotten to add a romantic scene at the beach of an Eastern Seaboard sunset where two lovers mutely stare at one another. And who else can gorgeously stir up a tear-inducing ending as much as he? Forget 500 Days of Summer trying to explore the complexities of falling in love with a Hall and Oates dance sequence and an Expectations vs. Reality analysis. Instead he always remembers to kill off a protagonist at the end. M. Night Shyamalan calls HIMSELF the master of unpredictable twists? Puh-lease! Mr. Sparks&#39; s death sequences are so surprising, that you could almost say they&#39; re completely unrelated to the genre that the previous two hours were aiming to be. <br/><br/>And when a movie like Precious thinks its portrayal of a teenage girl in emotional turmoil is accurate, it&#39; s alarmingly mistaken. There, the leading lady is impregnated by her own dad, sadistically beaten down by her mother, all while dealing with obesity and illiteracy on a daily basis. Ha! Like THAT happens in real life. It&#39; s really the Last Song&#39; s Ronnie who deserves our sympathy. I mean, she has to spend the entire summer in an intimidatingly adorable Georgia beach house, embrace the pressure of getting accepted into one of the country&#39; s most respected art schools and endure the creepy smile of her overly kind father. Now that&#39; s plausible drama – I only wish I had the guts to sullenly disregard MY dad whenever he greets me with genuine concern. This vision of teen angst fantastically brought to life by none other than Miley Cyrus. <br/><br/>Now there are those jealous haters out there, determined to bring her acting career down. But they don&#39; t understand the effort it takes from a performer to purse your lips and cross your arms for 90% of a film. Like me and my fellow Miley fans said – she&#39; s just playing herself. It&#39; s really those hacks like Johnny Depp and Meryl Streep who are destroying everything classic cinema stood for. Who do they think they are to disappear into the heart and soul of characters they don&#39; t relate to or resemble in reality? When I&#39; m watching a character on screen, I want to see the actor playing them. That&#39; s what made the most recent, Valentine&#39; s Day, so brilliant was that I could watch Jessica Alba being Jessica Alba the whole time yet grow blissfully unaware to her character&#39; s traits, abilities. . . heck, I couldn&#39; t even remember her name. <br/><br/>And mad props go out to Greg Kinnear in the role of a lifetime as the &quot; antagonistic&quot; father. A previous family drama of his called Little Miss Sunshine featured too much family and likedrama. It acted like each member had their own ambition and obstacle to deal with at the same time. What a load! This movie knows better, rather by making every other character&#39; s problems bow down to Ronnie&#39; s. In the Last Song, he delivers this performance, deserving the praise that Mo&#39; Nique received playing Mary Jones. Never mind the fact Ronnie frequently shoplifts and snubs Julliard just to make a point. It&#39; s really him who&#39; s to blame for everything. How dare you fall out of love and pursue a career that makes you happy, only to have the audacity to want to mend the wounds of your broken hearted family? I rooted throughout for Ronnie as she continuously tried to reconstruct the layers of guilt and avoidance upon his shoulders. That leads me to my one grievance of this movie; a rebellious teenage girl visiting her estranged dad and blames one of her separated parents for breaking the family apart. Really Nick? That&#39; s all just too unfamiliar of a premise for me. At best, the closest Ronnie ever came to resembling a character from one of your previous features was Diane Keaton&#39; s daughter from Nights in Rodanthe (pauses) Ohhh!",1
"I&#39; ll admit I was excited at first to see this movie. I had just finished the book a couple days ago and was psyched to see such an incredible book brought to the theater. The book was amazing: funny, romantic, sad, cheerful, pretty much everything you could want in a book. Well, everything that made the book great was taken out in this appallingly horrible movie. It felt torturous to watch what with Miley Cyrus absolutely slaughtering the character of Ronnie. After finishing the book, I realized I couldn&#39; t see her as the character, but I figured she couldn&#39; t be too horrible. Oh how wrong I was. <br/><br/>I didn&#39; t believe Miley Cyrus for a second during the real pivotal scenes in the movie. Her tears/crying scenes were laughable. Her attitude problem phase was obnoxious. The only relationship I believed was the one between her and the guy and that&#39; s because they&#39; re dating off screen. Oh how difficult it must be to act like you&#39; re in love with you&#39; re real life boyfriend. I wouldn&#39; t even call her performance mediocre. <br/><br/>And then comes the fact that this movie didn&#39; t even somewhat resemble the book. They took out the best scenes. They changed nearly EVERYTHING. They cut the preacher and the important back-story of her father. They didn&#39; t introduce the slightly similar sub plot with Scott very well at ALL. It was hinted at throughout the book, but in the movie it was sudden and not very well done at all. Actually, the majority of the scenes were done opposite of how they were done in the book, making them really bad. <br/><br/>Scott was more important in the book. Marcus was WAY more important in the book and he was one of those characters that was really kind of creepy. He was supposed to be a sociopath in the book, but in the movie he was just an annoying jerk. <br/><br/>They completely changed Ronnie&#39; s reasoning, the reason Will fell for Ronnie, and many more things. In the book they really showed how Ronnie was different than other girls. In this movie, Miley Cyrus made Ronnie seem like every other girl but with an attitudeproblem. Miley played her as such a clingy, needy girl instead of the independent, self-assured, and intelligent girl she was. <br/><br/>Then again, they changed more than they kept. If you want to know the GOOD story of The Last Song, do yourself a favor and buy the book. This movie wasn&#39; t worth the time and money. ",1
"Alright, first I shall note that I have not read the book. I hadn&#39; t even seen a trailer for this film before I had gone. I went with my mother and sister who had both read the book and more than enjoyed it. I really had no idea what this story was even about. I walked in with a completely open mind. <br/><br/>The acting in this movie was wonderful. On almost every account also. Greg Kinnear was amazing in the movie and the boy who played the son I was even impressed with. Miley Cyrus seemed to be the only exception. I hated her acting from the moment the movie began. As the movie went forth, I started to change my mind at times. She had no problem changing it back though. She was so off and on through out the entire film. She looked confused at times and when she actually had to show emotion like anger it was as if she didn&#39; t know what to do. But enough of that. <br/><br/>The story at times seemed rushed and misunderstood. Everything was predictable. The portions of the movie where I actually felt as though I was supposed to cry seemed to happen so fast that I felt like I didn&#39; t have time to understand how the characters felt. There were major holes in the plot that I still had questions about and it drove me nuts at times. There were a couple of times where I actually felt like I was enjoying it but they came and went quickly also. The whole movie, and please remember that I absolutely knew nothing about this story before hand, I felt like I had nothing to look forward to. <br/><br/>In the end I would say that I wouldn&#39; t suggest paying to see this in theaters. I definitely wouldn&#39; t buy it on DVD and I probably wouldn&#39; t even recommend renting it later. If by some chance you get an opportunity to see it for free and you&#39; re curious then go for it. I&#39; d also like to mention that, from what I understand from my mother and my sister, this movie completely differs from the book so don&#39; t expect what you&#39; ve read and definitely don&#39; t get to excited for this. ",4
"Grow up. The only reason why this movie has an average of 3. 1 is because of Miley Cyrus. People wont give her a chance and they feel they can only bring her down is by sitting behind a computer screen. But guess what people - I&#39; m sure she don&#39; t care! There is people who love this movie, like myself. People are going to watch it and people are going to buy it. So you giving it a 1 star rating is no harm. This movie needs at least a 6 or 7 star rating. <br/><br/>For the people who actually want this real review, this is it. Miley Cyrus isn&#39; t that bad, weird facial expressions at time but no harm. It&#39; s a really good tear jerker and a good story. ",10
"That&#39; s why sometimes I really should ignore IMDb&#39; s ratings! My parents went to see this movie last week and told me to watch it. And so I did it tonight. OK, Miley Cyrus isn&#39; t the best actress in the world and she&#39; s stuck to the Hanna Montana and so on kind of roles that she did. Even considering that, I don&#39; t get why do people hate her this much! She had a quite acceptable performance in this movie. I&#39; d give her a 6/10 stars rate, honestly believing that she&#39; ll improve a lot through her life as an actress. BUT WAIT! I really think we should rate this movie considering all the other things that compose it: a well-written and really moving story, an amazing soundtrack, a BRILLIANT Bobby Coleman&#39; s performance (WOOW! this kid will get very far in his career!) that almost made me shed a tear, a respectful cast, great landscapes and beautiful scenarios. . . There were some tiny moments with lack of total sense, and some slight errors of continuity, but totally harmless to the movie itself. Just stop hating the girl like she ruined the movie, because she did not do it at all. (and I swear I&#39; m not a MC fan)<br/><br/>Strongly recommended to watch with your lover!",7
"Miley Cyrus fans might hate me for saying this, but the makers of &quot; The Last Song&quot; should have hired a real actress for the lead role. Miley obviously doesn&#39; t have the talent or know how to act. I had nothing against her, but in this, the first role I&#39; ve seen her act in, it seemed like she was just playing herself and not playing any part that was written for her. <br/><br/>That said, &quot; The Last Song&quot; is a bust. It&#39; s a set of tired old recycled and clichéd experiences and really isn&#39; t worth the 107 minutes it takes to watch it. For the most part the storyline is so tired and old. And after watching it I was also disappointed that Greg Kinnear had signed up for it. That I can remember, I&#39; ve always liked his acting and the roles he chose. But in this case, the writing was so, so poor that even if the makers of &quot; The Last Song&quot; signed up the best actors in Hollywood it couldn&#39; t save this film. They&#39; d have to find some writers who were at a minimum mediocre-ish in order to improve this story. <br/><br/>All I can say is save yourself and watch something else. ",4
"I didn&#39; t read the book, didn&#39; t want to. A bunch of my friends went to go see this movie, and I went with them. There are a few things wrong with this movie. First, Miley Cyrus cannot act. I mean, at all. It&#39; s painful to watch. Second, there is no originality. Just mix up a bit Twilight and most of Dear John, and you&#39; ve got rather predictable The Last Song. Third, the characters. Ronnie is annoying enough without Cyrus, unbearable with her. She was such a brat at the beginning that I felt no pity the rest of the movie. Will makes several idiotic mistakes that cause Ronnie to have another temper tantrum. The little brother is cute, but irritating at times. Overall, this is just a flat, overrated chick flick that has the depth of a Disney Channel movie. ",4
"And how can it have the score of 3. 2?<br/><br/>It was one of the most touching and real movies I have ever seen, and I&#39; ve seen my share of great touching movies (Casablanca, Wuthering Heights, The Notebook, It&#39; s A Wonderful Life, Rain Man). <br/><br/>I&#39; m not comparing this movie with the greatest movies of all time, I&#39; m only saying that it has the heart and soul to be a film that you remember and cherish in your heart. <br/><br/>When this world becomes more and more apathetic with each day passing, I think this film brings back the feelings that we forgot and neglected, and that&#39; s just not a bad thing. <br/><br/>I give this movie 10/10, because it crawled underneath my skin and into my heart. And that&#39; s what a great film supposed to do, in my opinion. ",10
"It&#39; s been 5 years since I&#39; ve reviewed a movie on IMDb, but oh. . . I am compelled! Where do we start? One of the producers has the last name of Cyrus, so I guess that explains a lot. But let&#39; s forget Miley&#39; s &quot; acting&quot; and address the story itself. I&#39; ve always thought Sparks overuses death to illicit emotion in his readers/viewers (even though The Notebook and Message in a Bottle are two of my favorite films). But that aside, was there a single un-contrived moment in this film? They (whoever &quot; they&quot; is) tried to squeeze every type of plot device imaginable into this movie. So many cliché conflicts going on, I laughed more times than I can count. Hope I didn&#39; t disturb the other two people (both teen-aged girls) in the theater. However, hats off to Kinnear for an honest performance. ",1
"I just saw this movie today with a friend. Let me start off by saying I&#39; m totally impartial toward Miley Cyrus b/c I think a lot of bad reviews on this movie will only make a point of how bad she is. I really didn&#39; t find this to be the case. Honestly, the problem with this movie lies in the story. It was very random from start to finish (as my friend pointed out, starting off slowly and then rushing sloppily to an end to try to tie things together) and had very expected &#39; twists&#39; . During the whole movie, my friend and I kept predicting the next sequence of events. {The perfect &#39; everyone&#39; s-together-Dad-finally-accepted-my-boyfriend&#39; scene: i turn to my friend, &quot; someone&#39; s going to die&quot; . Dad gets up: my friend says &quot; oh, something&#39; s gonna happen to him&quot; , the fact that Will ends up considering Columbia, that they end up together, etc. etc. } Also, this was full of clichés {the fact that Ronnie believed whatever the stupid blonde girl told her and then got all angry with Will for it on a dime, the separated couple gets back together, a child is resentful and rebellious over her parents&#39; divorce, there&#39; s a character who&#39; s filthy rich but still has problems in his life--all big shocks} And so many random parts of the plot. For instance, Will lost his brother. We can already tell from his mother that his family/life isn&#39; t perfect. Why did they even need that? I mean, his father only mentions that brother once during dinner with Ronnie I think. It was very useless to me. And the way that Will was actually connected to the church fire thing through his friend and that&#39; s why the stained-glass window is so important and also what eventually causes Ronnie to reject Will was SO sloppily done. It was as if everything was supposed to be connected but it just came out jumbled and messy. THEN we have Ronnie and the acting. I don&#39; t blame Miley Cyrus. I don&#39; t blame *any* of the actors. Their lines were horrible and awkward. Their emotional ranges were so random I couldn&#39; t get in tune with any of the characters. The actors were so close to fitting the molds of their characters but then something would happen and it would get awkward again. And the way they had Ronnie transition from &#39; rebellious&#39; to softened was choppy and strange. The actors did what they could with their dialogue and characters but in my opinion this was just badly written. I did cry at the end b/c they really do pull at your emotions, what with the song and the light and close-ups of the brother crying, it was hard to watch. But the whole time I was thinking &quot; this really is a bad movie&quot; . And that&#39; s how I left. Feeling that I had just seen a bad movie. What I will say is that I at least appreciated the acting (making due with those choppy scenes) and a few transition techniques of some scenery shots which were actually quite beautiful and artistic. The highlights were definitely just the settings and scenery, as well as Cyrus&#39; piano playing. But not a movie I&#39; d recommend. Just skip it. ",3
"Enter Veronica &#39; Ronnie&#39; Miller, a recently graduated seventeen-year-old with an attitude problem, divorced parents, a fresh shoplifting arrest and combat boots. When Ronnie is sent from New York to Georgia to live with her dad for the summer, she is less than thrilled and at first resists letting anyone in. <br/><br/>Enter Will Blakelee, a rich small town &#39; hunk&#39; (if you will), with volleyball skill and charm. Not exactly a rebellious teen aged girl&#39; s cup of tea, right? Well. . . not quite. <br/><br/>Ronnie, played by Disney&#39; s princess Miley Cyrus, seems set not falling for anyone over the summer. But she ends up doing the opposite. Will&#39; s (Liam Hemsworth, Australian newbie) consistency pays off after just a couple of run-ins. He&#39; s writing &#39; Forever&#39; on Ronnie&#39; s converse and playfully pushing her into the ocean before she even comes to fairly good terms with her piano-playing father, Steve. (Greg Kinnear) The fast pace relationship was sweet, considering it&#39; s between teenagers. Nothing like cliché summer romance, huh? If only there was more depth to the relationship. . . (not counting Will&#39; s secretly damaged family, and Ronnie&#39; s dramatic anger towards her dad) . . . then maybe it would have been a more successful movie as a whole. <br/><br/>I&#39; m not going to blame Cyrus&#39; ability to act (or maybe lack thereof) on the low points of the film. I&#39; ll actually give it to her, she did a nice job transitioning from little miss Hannah Montana to a darker, not as tween-based character. There is always room for improvement, however, as she seems to get bored of her alter ego throughout the film. But all in all, I did find her likable for the most part. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, I cannot really complain or bash The Last Song. It was a debut in a lot of ways. . . Julie Anne Robinson&#39; s directorial debut, Nicholas Spark writing a screenplay debut, and Miley&#39; s debut as someone other than Hannah. So, cut it some slack. Excuse the sometimes cheesy moments and keep your mind open. <br/><br/>6/10, Not too shabby. ",6
"The Last Song is a great movie. It is a coming of age movie but not just a chick flick. All family members will enjoy this movie. Miley Cyrus plays a somewhat troubled teen and blames her troubles on her parents divorce. Her attitude quickly takes a turn when she falls in love and even more of a turn when she finds out that her father is dying with lung cancer. Take a box of tissues to the theatre. Miley plays this dramatic role very well. <br/><br/>In this movie you will be introduced to turtle eggs and you will see them crawl back to the ocean when they hatch. I think this is interesting for children of all ages to watch. <br/><br/>Go watch this movie and go as a family. We don&#39; t get many of these type movies so make it a family day and go. You won&#39; t be sorry. <br/><br/>Although some young children are upset that the series Hannah Montana has ended, I have to say I am glad. Miley Cyrus has so much more to offer to the entertainment business than her role as Hannah Montana. I think we will see her in many, many, more movies. ",10
"OK. I&#39; ll be honest. I am a 19 year old guy who went to see this with a few on my friends(18 years old) and we enjoyed it immensely. Haha. I am quite fond of Mileys little poppy catchy songs(and I like hard rock music, go figure!) I was singing along with my friends and we just had fun. Thats what this movie is about, just have fun with it. The movie was pretty good. Just plain fun. Though, my one issue is I really do not like how Disney exploits its stars at all. But none the less, the movie was just fun. : D Any little Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus fan will be fond of this, to bad its not in theaters anymore(even though this was Disney just trying to make more millions of its produce i. e-Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus). ",10
"Well, I am a pretty big book worm, so when I found out that this was being made into a movie, I made an effort to read the book. I&#39; d already read a few of Nicholas Sparks&#39; books, and their adaptations were typical - missing plot lines etc. - but surprisingly good. But this book was incredible. The plot lines showed major attention to detail, and the twists and turns that this writer takes you on are so convincing. <br/><br/>But enough about the amazing book. Let&#39; s just say, my positivity basically ends there. Because the movie was horrible. I was pretty convinced when it began that it would turn out to be a good movie, but as soon as Miley Cyrus appears on the screen, it turns for the worst. <br/><br/>Miley Cyrus just doesn&#39; t fit the part. She doesn&#39; t actually make an effort to fit into the shoes of Ronnie Miller. Ronnie, in the book, is hardly Miss. Princess, and neither is the character that Miley chooses to play, but there is a huge difference between the two. But overall, I just don&#39; t think that she&#39; s actually capable of playing a character as deep as Ronnie. And it looks as though she hasn&#39; t actually tried. <br/><br/>I give positive reviews for the brother Jonah, and the father. Jonah was quirky and funny without being too dumb. He was funny at the right times and serious at the right times. I thought that the father definitely portrayed the character in the book to a really good standard. In both the book and the movie, these two have a really good bond, and I&#39; m glad to see that this has been maintained. <br/><br/>Now, Marcus and his crew are hardly featured in the movie, which is a real letdown. In the book, Marcus basically stalks Ronnie, but in the movie, he is barely even featured. Blaze is pretty good, but they definitely could have involved her more. <br/><br/>Will, played by Liam Hemsworth, was pretty good, I found. I&#39; m probably a bit biased seeing that I&#39; m an Aussie myself, but as soon as he spoke, I was a bit sad. Most Aussie actors these days ditch their rightful accent, and the only time where I noticed his was when he tried to sing. I suppose you can&#39; t keep it out all the time. The way he played Will was. . . alright. Not brilliant, but probably better than his gf. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie lacked the feeling of the book, as it left out major scenes and plots. It was a real letdown, because I walked into the cinema expecting an experience true to the book, and if it had been, it would have been absolutely amazing. <br/><br/>But without a doubt, this was amazingly awful. My only advice - sit down and read the book instead of wasting your money on a ticket and the unnecessary popcorn. ",2
"A fitting quote that speaks volumes of The Last Song, &quot; The pieces all fit together, yet everything was falling apart&quot; , expresses the opinions of the watchers of the movie. The Last Song, another installation in the line of Nicholas Sparks&#39; novels-turned-movies, centers on a teenage girl, her summer romance, and her relationship with her father. The movie features big names in acting, like Greg Kinnear and Kelly Preston, while spotlighting new faces in acting, for example Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus. Although Cyrus is not a new celebrity name, The Last Song is her first silver screen acting role. Cyrus is a big name among tween girls for her role as Hannah Montana, and her singing career is starting to take off. However, acting in semi-serious roles or in movies at all might not be in her future. While Miley Cyrus does have a popular fan base to support her endeavors, The Last Song proves that Cyrus does not have the chops to be a great or even good actress, as expressed through her demeanor on screen, as well as through the reviews on her acting. <br/><br/>To illustrate the sub-par acting of Cyrus, the audience should pay close attention to how she acts. Even though the character of Ronnie was already a teen with a bad attitude, Cyrus adds the element of bad acting. In a review for the New York Times, writer A. O. Scott claims that Cyrus &quot;Most of the time she seems to be play-acting rather than exploring the motives and feelings of her character. &quot; Scott is absolutely true. Cyrus mopes around on screen, not really having much emotion or, when she does, it is sometimes exaggerated. For example, when Cyrus and Hemsworth guard the turtle eggs overnight, she does not really delve deeply into the emotions of her character, but rather just seems to be reading the lines. Claudia Puig, a reporter for USA Today, reports that Cyrus &quot; sulks and sneers her way through her first dramatic role&quot; , and that she has &quot; shaky dramatic bets. &quot; To counter the harsh reviews, Roger Ebert, a renowned movie critic, believes that Cyrus &quot; seems sincere&quot; and &quot; Her acting is unaffected, she can play serious. &quot; Cyrus may have some parts of the movie where she is serious, like when she and Kinnear finish the song and Kinnear&#39; s funeral, but most of the time she is not attached to her character. For most of The Last Song, Cyrus demonstrates how unexperienced her acting truly is. An example would be when she and Hemsworth have a fight around the middle of the movie. Cyrus explains to Hemsworth why she is mad at him, but Cyrus seems to not actually mean what she is saying; like she is just saying it to say it. Another scene in the movie that displays her less-than- stellar acting is another scene with Hemsworth. Again, she seems to be saying the lines, but not meaning them or having an ounce of conviction when the lines are spoken. Whenever Cyrus and Hemsworth have a scene together, which is almost every scene in the movie, Cyrus never gives the impression that she feels a romantic connection between her character and Hemsworth&#39; s character. The lack of chemistry could be a result from Cyrus&#39; s unemotional acting. ",4
"Having only heard great things about the book, and drastic opinions on the movie, my friend and i thought we would give it a try. Midway through, we are bawling, holding one another&#39; s hand. Yes, Miley Cyrus may not be the best, and yes some parts were predictable, but I still loved the movie an incredible amount. Miley portrays an obnoxious teenager, as she should. And the predictability only prepares us emotional people ahead of time. I love being able to feel as if I know the characters, and with the Last Song, I could. I have nothing bad to say about this film, and sometimes we all need a good cry. Or a family drama love story. Nicholas Sparks has always pleased most, and I believe he has done it again. ",9
"My 14 year old daughter and I (39 year old woman) went to see this together and both hated it. We both had read the book and loved it so we decided to see the movie. <br/><br/>The people who play Miley Cyrus&#39; little brother and father were excellent and had a lot of great lines, but unfortunately Miley Cyrus and her boyfriend, absolutely, completely, can not act. And since they are the main focus of the movie it dragged on and on. The dialogue was very straightforward and boring. <br/><br/>This is the only movie I have ever seen that I was contemplating walking out. ",1
"This is a perfect example of how to spoil a master piece. I am so sorry for Nicholas Sparks who wrote a wonderful book only to be ruined by a bad screenplay, terrible editing and ordinary acting. All those who have read the book should be able to appreciate what I am talking about. Julie Anne Robinson has tried to use her creativity and tweak the story here and there but all she has managed to do is to ruin the whole plot. Some things are just better left untouched is the lesson she should learn out of it. Miley Cyrus is a huge disappointment and it seems she wasn&#39; t a good choice in the first place. She failed miserably to do what Mandy Moore did to &quot; A Walk To Remember&quot; . On the whole, the movie gives the impression that they have just somehow managed to narrate the whole story in the 108 minutes given to them without really worrying about retaining the emotionally charged plot Nicholas Sparks had created. Thumbs down all the way : (",5
"This is a movie that is absolutely predictable, badly acted and difficult to endure. Miley Cyrus&#39; s acting is honestly so awful that it is impossible to forget for even a moment that her entire career is funded by her father. Even the background music is overdone and obvious, like a bad soap opera. There is nothing about this movie that is original - think of almost any cliché and it is in this movie. I tried to sit through it non-judgmentally, thinking that I may have been too harsh about Miley Cyrus and the whole &quot; Disney/Hanna Montana&quot; debacle, and I thought that just maybe, Miley (and her father&#39; s choices) might have improved with time. . . but - no. No spoilers here - it is too easy, just think of any bad movie plot you have ever seen, and it is thrown into this movie. . ",1
I&#39; ve been reading all the other reviews for this movie and to be honest I think they are all wrong. The acting is excellent in this film. Miley brings her own personal touch to the character Ronnie. Yes the film is slightly different from the book but you will never find a film that&#39; s exact from the book. I would really recommend this movie it has lots of different emotions in it. <br/><br/>Miley has also changed the way she acts. Now she is more grown up in this movie and she is playing a part where she has never used her acting in this way. This movie just shows how good of an actress she is. The rest of the cast acting is also very good. The music used in the movie is also excellent. I don&#39; t think I can find any faults to this movie and think you should really see the movie before you read the book because you will be disappointed but I didn&#39; t see the movie based on the book I saw it because of the trailer. If you like sad emotional films I would really recommend it. Best film I&#39; ve seen this year. ,10
"I read the book before seeing the movie. i couldn&#39; t put the book down and i was hoping the movie would be just as good but i was so let down. i (as well as another review had said) kept thinking about the book and all of the important things that were left out. I felt like my friend was missing all the major details. I really loved the book, but walking out of the theater i was actually more mad than anything. It could have been a really great movie, it just needed to be more like the book. I wish there weren&#39; t major details left out and parts being completely different from how they were in the book. Some characters weren&#39; t nearly as important as they were in the book. I would suggest not reading the book before you see it. you&#39; ll be disappointed. I would definitely read the book after though. ",3
"A drama centered on a rebellious girl who is sent to a Southern beach town for the summer to stay with her father. Through their mutual love of music, the estranged duo learn to reconnect. <br/><br/>Well you could probably already tell I would have no whatsoever &#39; expectation&#39; for this movie. It did sound like an interesting film, let&#39; s get that straight. It had potential to be something at least average. It had potential to be more, possibly. But there&#39; s only one reason why this movie doesn&#39; t get it right is Miley Cyrus. If your going to try to provoke the audience to feel something, to move them, do not cast Miley Cyrus. She&#39; s a gimmick, and she has no acting talent whatsoever. Her antics are laughable, and her ways to try to &quot; act&quot; are just so funny. The rest of the cast was a bit of a joke too. Who casts two horrible lead actors? I mean, are they really trying to approach nonsense? Are they really trying to make this a serious movie? Because nothing is done in a professional way. The movie looks as if it was produced my a bunch of whiny teenagers who were such BIG fans of the novel. This was directing by a first-timer, but that doesn&#39; t give it any excuse for trying to get past the clichés. Did I forget to mention? If your going to attempt to move the audience, creating something the audience has already seen is not going to do anything. Quite frankly, it&#39; s going to make the audience cringe. <br/><br/>This movie will only appeal to your teenage daughter. It&#39; s a chick flick, that consists of being as formulaic as most everything today. And that sucks, because maybe the movie had potential. But potential that would never be savored. If you like horribly-acted chick flicks with no depth or emotion, here it is. If you like movies in general, avoid at all costs. <br/><br/>1/10. ",1
"This girl has NO talent whatsoever. She cannot sing and she definitely cannot act. I couldn&#39; t enjoy the movie because of her. Anyone. . and I mean ANYONE would have been better than miley for this role. She is just too immature for a movie like this. I&#39; m obviously not a fan of her music, but I thought hey. . why not go see her on the big screen. Big mistake. It was a waste of time and money. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. Miley should not call herself an actress. There are plenty of women out there who actually can act, yet i&#39; m so confused as to why Miley was chosen for this movie. I hope she never gets a role like this again. ",1
"Beauty in the midst of all the ugliness we&#39; re living in, it&#39; s like a shock. I wept like I hadn&#39; t wept in a movie since I was very young. It made me think and remember summers of my own life. It made remember sounds and smells. I was transported. The smartness, candor and gentleness of this unexpected love story goes beyond anything I&#39; ve ever seen. Luca Guadagnino is rapidly becoming one my favorite directors working today. Armie Hammer completely demolished my preconceptions with a performance that is total perfection and I haven&#39; t mention Timothee Chalamet yet. No I need to dedicate the lasts paragraphs to him because his performance goes beyond perfection. I didn&#39; t know him at all. Now I&#39; a fan. It reminded me of the first time I saw Daniel Day Lewis playing a gay punk in &quot; My Beautiful Launderette&quot; An explosion of beauty when you least expected. Thank you for that. ",10
"Call Me By Your Name is the kind of movie that makes you sit through the credits with tears rolling down your face, staring blankly at the screen with a lump in your throat and tightness in your chest. <br/><br/>Call Me By Your Name is not a tragic movie. It&#39; s not a sad movie. It&#39; s not a pretentious movie. It&#39; s a movie about love, and love, and love. A beautiful love that will leave you longing to find your own love and drown in it. <br/><br/>Timothée Chalamet is an absolute force of nature. Elio will make you want to love, and hurt, and piece yourself back together with absolutely no regrets whatsoever. Elio will make you want to live your life to the fullest. Elio will make you want to break your own damn heart. It&#39; s so rare that a performance truly shows the depth of longing, and despair, and passion a character conveys through written words without the internal monologue. Timothée is truly a revelation and his last scene during the credits will have a lasting impact on everyone. <br/><br/>Armie Hammer is absolutely brilliant in the way he humanizes Oliver who is somewhat glorified through Elio&#39; s lens in the first part of the book. In the movie, Oliver is endearing and human and sexy and caring. He cares for Elio, and his love for him is so tender and so touching<br/><br/>Michael Stuhlbarg&#39; s monologue delivered nearing the end of the film is a complete masterpiece, and without a doubt that monologue with be taught and quoted for many years to come. A raw and beautiful scene. <br/><br/>Watch this movie. Watch it, and love it, and don&#39; t let it fall victim to over-hype. Watch this movie. Fall in love in two hours and twelve minutes, then question every single time you didn&#39; t allow yourself to feel just because you were afraid of getting hurt. Was avoiding a possible heartbreak that might have shattered you worth never getting a taste of the heavens? Was killing the potential pain and heartache worth it? Was it worth it?",10
"If you&#39; ve read the book, you will not be disappointed. If you&#39; ve not read the book, you must. They fit together as a beautiful work together. Companions in art. One without the other, and you just aren&#39; t as fulfilled. I cannot wait to reread the book. <br/><br/>Timothée&#39; s performance is one for the history books. The Adele Excharpolous à la Blue is the Warmest Color of the year. His eyes are so expressive and every emotion and action is so deeply felt by this poor tortured soul that by the ending you cannot help but weep and feel at the absolute lowest you&#39; ve ever been. <br/><br/>Armie is portrayed to perfection, as well. His &quot; later&quot; and other phrases stand out so sharply in a world of prompt and prim dialect that it makes us feel engaged in a way that I&#39; ve never felt by a movie. He was such an outsider and yet we were assimilating to his was as opposed to the way it should be. He, a guest, in Italy, for 6 weeks, leaves just as American as the day he arrived. <br/><br/>Luca&#39; s obsession with men dancing and swimming pools and beautifully choreographed sex, is perfect for this story. I cannot think of a better match. Luca said in the Q&amp; A afterward that he decided to change a few things from the book because not everything written in prose works on screen in a cinematic way, and if you&#39; ve read the book, you will agree. He also said the author, who makes a small cameo in the film, thinks Luca&#39; s changes are better than the original form. So, that&#39; s affirming. <br/><br/>Peach scene? Devastating. Sufjan&#39; s new songs? Devastating. <br/><br/>This was a very sad movie but I loved every second. Let&#39; s hope Suspiria is even better. Luca G. might be the most exciting director working today. It was a privilege to watch this with him and the amazing cast and crew INCLUDING Sufjan. I hope Sony Pictures Classics doesn&#39; t mess up the distribution/awards campaign. This deserves praise. <br/><br/>Also, 10/10 opening credits/font. Luca can do no wrong. ",10
"I cried my eyes out. It was cleansing and reinvigorating. Timothee Chalamet is the living image of a friend from my childhood. He had a similar experience but a very different outcome and it made me think with a broken heart that if my friend had had a father like Elio&#39; s father he could have had a real chance at a happy, constructive life, instead of the agonizing pain that he went through. I hadn&#39; t though about him for years and Timothee brought him back to me with enormous power. What a beautiful, beautiful performance. Armie Hammer is a total revelation, the perfect foil for a first love. Michael Stuhlbarg introduces us to a character I had never seen on the screen before. He moved me no end, Then, of course, Luca Guadagnino. My hat to you sir. This is a film I will see many times. ",10
"There were many scenes in this movie that stuck with me, most of which have probably been discussed to death (the dad, the peach, the sheer pleasure of sitting around reading, swimming, and doing whatever you want unsupervised). <br/><br/>I think as an American, one of the things that stuck to my bones was how the parents reacted to their son&#39; s sexuality. I don&#39; t mean his homosexuality. I mean, sexuality as a whole. Despite most of the key characters being American, they all have a European sensibility that it very rare to see here in the US. One could argue that the movie itself could be making a social comment about open, honest European views of sex vs. moralizing, restrictive American views. <br/><br/>First, the parents see their son is attracted to a man, so they do things to help facilitate that attraction by giving them the idea to travel alone together. They also let Elio and Oliver have their space in the house - they aren&#39; t monitoring Elio or &quot; checking up on him, &quot; which I found refreshing. <br/><br/>Second, the parents are genuinely always there for Elio in helping him discuss sexual relationships. He is able to say to his parents out loud, &quot; I could never be that open, &quot; a vulnerable statement I have trouble imagining ever having expressed to my parents. They simply reassure him; they don&#39; t nag or moralize him about sex. Of course, there&#39; s the scene with the father discussing his own sexual past and desires, openly and without judgment that exemplifies this behavior. <br/><br/>Third, the adults in the movie treat Elio respectfully with regards to his sexual encounters. For example, when Elio greets the older gay couple with Marzia and quickly gives her a kiss and loving pat, the adults simply maturely greet her and say hello. No one says &quot; Ohhhhhhh! You have a GIRRRLFRIENND!!!!!!!!!&quot; In the US, I find it typical that adults make teasing comments and condescending &quot; jokes&quot; about &quot; how cute it is to have a crush&quot; to teenagers. This moralizing can make teens internalize that they are doing something wrong, when they are actually doing something natural. <br/><br/>To see adults treat Elio respectfully and collegially, like a mature young adult for whom sex is one of many natural, positive experiences, filled me with hope, jealousy, and a strong feeling about the kind of parent one should be when one has teenagers. It&#39; s not very common you walk out of a movie thinking, &quot; This movie has changed or informed the way I want to live my life&quot; but this one has for me. <br/><br/>Last, I think we are in a particular time where we are really looking back on the 1980s with a specific nostalgia for a time when kids could just be kids, ride their bikes everywhere, have adventures, be home for dinner, then go out again and have more unsupervised adventures. Stranger Things, It, and this film all are really tapping into that nostalgia, albeit in slightly different ways. <br/><br/>The music in this movie is what I can only describe as beautiful, Sufjan&#39; s songs in particular stand out as incredibly moving. Visions of Gideon is an absolute soul crusher. The music added to the atmosphere of the movie, which was so warm and peaceful. It was so refreshing to see a movie about two men in a relationship that didn&#39; t end with one of them dying or angry parents, nothing of the sort. Time is the villain here, and I think that makes it all the more tragic. ",8
"It doesn&#39; t take a genius to understand nor appreciate this film. It does however, take an open mind to see and feel the beauty this film has to offer. It is perfection incarnate. Never have I been so moved by a film such as this one. It was an absolute pleasure watching it. ",10
"Call Me By Your Name is a complicated but powerful story filled with emotion and beauty. It addresses two people and the feelings they have for each other in a breathtaking way. It demonstrates how adolescent love can be both adventurous and difficult. The two strong leads equally contribute to the overall impact viewers feel from the beginning to the end of the film. Many films that have male leads fail to embrace the true emotions they feel. This film does the opposite. It shows all of the raw and true emotion that each character feels. At the beginning of the film, I feel like it lacked some context in explaining who Oliver was exactly. Other than that, everything else was clear and thoroughly thought out.
Elio Perlman is a 17 year old boy who spends his summer in Italy with his family. Elio&#39; s father invites a graduate student named Oliver to stay with them and to work as an intern. Over the course of the summer, Elio and Oliver begin to explore their relationship and eventually fall in love. With Elio being only 17, he is confused and his emotions are constantly in flux. Elio has been coming to Italy every summer since he can remember. With no responsibilities, Elio is able to take on many hobbies such as music, reading, and biking. He knows his way around town, and many of locals as well. A summer romance with a local girl has been going on, but there is something about Oliver that makes Elio feel a different way with an instant connection.
With the story set in the Lombardy region of northern Italy in the summer, it makes for truly beautiful scenery. I was fascinated by the elegance of the architecture and landscape shown throughout the film. It added to the love story and worry free environment. The scenes of them swimming in the rivers and biking through the city are things that make the film have the charming romance that is does. The shots were stunning and visually pleasing to watch.
Because the film is set in Italy in 1983, same-sex relationships would not be entirely accepted. Elio and Oliver act hesitant to admit that they have feelings for each other. Eventually they do show their feelings and admit to one another. The film does an amazing job at portraying this idea and displaying the situation similarly to how it would be if it was actually during this time period. Another movie that came to mind when analyzing this one, was Love Simon. Both films consist of same-sex relationships that start off being timid and end up being something special with a significant impact on the audience.
Throughout the film, the acting was constantly impressive. Elio, played by Timothée Chalamet performs in such an organic and confident way, which makes viewers even more drawn to the story. Oliver, played by Armie Hammer, perfectly portrays a man who is intelligent, charming, and empathetic towards Elio who is a lot younger than him. Not only is the acting outstanding, but Elio is shown playing the piano and speaking three different languages. The film production and costumes portray the rural part of Italy in the late 1980&#39; s exactly.
The soundtrack includes a mix of classical, and subtle italian themed music that incorporates into the film perfectly. The film has a relaxed type of feel, and the music illustrates that in a exceptional way. Being that the whole film was shot with a 35mm camera lens is not only extremely impressive, but allows for the scenes to feel more realistic and effective to the viewers.
The overall story focuses more on the emotional connection between the characters instead of the characters themselves. It embraces the things that come with first love and inevitable heartbreak. The jealousy, the nervous energy, and the sensitivity. The message is executed in such a impactful way. In one of the last scenes of the film, Elio is heart broken after Oliver leaves. His father comforts him and tells him that what him and Oliver had was special. His father responds in such a positive way that makes Elio feel very accepted and loved for who he is. His father tells him how powerful love can be and that he is happy for Elio. This strong connection between a father and son creates such a positive message to the audience. The impact this movie has on viewers is beyond words. The film leaves us with the gorgeous song that Sufjan Stevens wrote which wraps the film up in a brilliant way. ",10
"*****This review may contain spoilers!!!!*****<br/><br/>I have just finished reading the book. It is deeply moving. I am still in a daze. Heartbreaking and inspiring at the same time. The film adaptation is erotic, cinematic, well acted, and painfully beautiful, as Luca Guadagnino&#39; s other film, I Am Love (starring the luminous Tilda Swinton). <br/><br/>What makes the theme universal? To my eyes, it has to do with the complex issue of love and loss. The film and the book deal with love/loss not in the simple sense of losing the person we love, but in the sense of deliberately losing the person we love so we can sustain loving and desiring the person. &quot; I can&#39; t love you unless I give you up&quot; could be the line (not from the book or film) that captures the relation between Elio and Oliver. <br/><br/>Both Elio and Oliver maintain the minimal distance between them instead of fully committing to their desire &#39; til the end. Which makes their love the sad kind. As Elio said, &quot; Time makes us sentimental. &quot; The right time never arrives for Elio and Oliver. They relate to each other from the lenses of the past (&quot; pluperfect&quot; love, to borrow Elio&#39; s wording) and the future. It is never now. The thematic is appealing because it speaks to many of us who have loved and continue to love on the basis of the fundamental loss at the heart of desire. Is there a way out of this spiral? Is there another way of approaching love? These are questions the book and the movie leave the reader/viewer to answer. The ending is unhappy yet &quot; satisfying&quot; , precisely because this satisfaction involves a mix of hope and agony. It keeps the movement of desire in motion, for both Elio and Oliver, and for the reader/viewer. <br/><br/>PS: I can&#39; t help but reflect on this great film vis-à-vis Guadagnino&#39; s another great film, I Am Love, where the two protagonists literally leave their respective worlds behind to be in a world that they both share. ",10
"This film is pure sensuality and emotion. You can see through the character&#39; s eyes, taste through their mouths but most importantly you feel, by God how you feel. Luca Guadagnino manages to extract the very best out of his actors: Armie Hammer&#39; s performance shows unprecedented depth and Timothee Chalamet is the essence of awe inspiring acting, this film will land him an Oscar nomination at the very least.

"It&#39; s hard for me to talk about this film without just hurling adjectives at the page; it&#39; s tender, beautiful, sexy, hilarious and deeply moving - a romance story for the ages, directed and acted with a passionate sincerity. ",10
"Chiron, in Barry Jenkins&#39; Oscar-winning film &quot; Moonlight, &quot; in addition to being gay and black, has to deal with drug abuse, bullying, and the lack of a supportive home environment. In contrast, in Luca Guadagnino&#39; s (&quot; A Bigger Splash&quot; ) achingly beautiful Call Me by Your Name, 17-year-old Elio&#39; s (Timothée Chalamet, &quot; Love the Coopers&quot; ) life is safe, comfortable, and surrounded by love though, like Chiron, he must come to terms with his true identity. Written by three-time Oscar nominee James Ivory and adapted from the 2007 novel by Andre Aciman, Call Me by Your Name is set in the summer of 1983 where Oliver (Armie Hammer, &quot; Free Fire&quot; ) is an American research assistant studying with art history Professor Perlman (Michael Stuhlbarg, &quot; Steve Jobs&quot; ) at Perlman&#39; s gorgeous villa in Northern Italy. <br/><br/>Oliver arrives at this idyllic setting with its gardens, peach trees, and lakes to greet the professor, his wife Annella (Amira Casar, &quot; Planetarium&quot; ) a lover of German poetry, and his teenage son Elio who speaks several languages and transcribes piano scores for the guitar. Shot by Thai cinematographer Sayombhu Mukdeeprom (&quot; Uncle Boonmee Who Can Recall His Past Lives&quot; ) and buoyed by new songs from Sufjan Stevens, it is easy to feel yourself present in the languid summer afternoon, as Aciman expresses it, &quot; with the scent of rosemary, the heat, the birds, the cicadas, the sway of palm fronds, the silence that falls like a light linen shawl on an appallingly sunny day. &quot; <br/><br/>With Oliver&#39; s arrival, Elio now has to shift his focus from pursuing his French girlfriend Marzia (Esther Garrel, &quot; Daydreams&quot; ) to show the American student around town and give him bike tours of the area. Soon, however, he becomes annoyed by the American&#39; s brusque manner and his abrupt &quot; later&quot; whenever he&#39; s leaving. When Elio, who is Jewish, sees Oliver wearing a Star of David on a chain around his neck, however, he finds a common bond, jokingly telling him that his mother considers their family to be &quot; Jews in discretion. &quot; Sharing the same bathroom, their friendship begins to expand when they engage in conversation and go swimming together. Although Oliver gives Elio a neck massage during a volley ball game, the boy seems unable or unwilling to process the feelings that it brings up in him. <br/><br/>When Oliver causally tells Elio that he seems to know everything, the teenager confesses that he knows everything except &quot; what really matters. &quot; Even when physical intimacy is established, there is the sense that they hold back from fully expressing their feelings and even prefer not to talk about them. Chalamet, in his first leading role, is a revelation, delivering a deeply affecting performance that shows great promise. Hammer&#39; s performance is restrained, but also fully believable, making sure that the age difference does not get in the way of the honest and genuine relationship they have established. As they strengthen their friendship, like lovers, their identities blend into each other and they express it verbally by taking each other&#39; s name. Call Me by Your Name is not an &quot; us versus them&quot; movie. There are no antagonists in the film. It is a celebration of love in all its wonder and mystery. <br/><br/>There is gay sex in the movie but, like &quot; Moonlight, &quot; it is about more than sex. As Guadagnino says, &quot; it is about compassion, trust, and wisdom. &quot; All three of these values are expressed in the conversation between Elio and his dad, an interchange that is moving and wise. Though the film is &quot; gay-themed, &quot; Guadagnino does not pigeonhole the characters into familiar categories and his refusal to deal in stereotypes or manufactured emotion gives the film the space to breathe and reach the place where tension can grow. Like &quot; Moonlight, &quot; Call Me by Your Name has a universal appeal and can touch anyone, gay or straight, who has ever felt the confused and conflicting longings of first love, or who knows from experience that, in the words of the song &quot; Plaisir d&#39; amour, &quot; &quot; The joy of love is but a moment long. The pain of love endures the whole life long. &quot; ",10
"It is not often that films adapted from books capture the true essence, emotion and spirit of the book but for me Call Me By Your Name does just that. Superbly acted by a talented cast the film was a visual an emotional delight. Sensitively directed and beautifully shot with a great sound track what was not to like. For me it was a coming of age love story for Elio and something very special for Oliver. Simply calling it a gay movie does it a disservice. It is much, much more than that. While the whole cast were strong the two leads, Armie, and Timothee just had that magic on screen. And Timothee Chalamet&#39; s performance was stunning absolutely stunning. His closing scene will become a cinema classic. Don&#39; t be put off by the gay tag this is a beautiful love story, sensitively told that surly anybody can empathise with. Don&#39; t miss it. ",10
"The most sensually immersive film you will see all year, perhaps all decade. The performances from the cast - notably Hammer, Stuhlbarg and particularly newcomer Chalamet put this film in another league from all other recent coming-of-age films and romance films. You leave this film wishing you could stay in the world it has enveloped you within. ",10
"First, to all the Americans on here outraged about the film &quot; endorsing&quot; a criminal act - NEWS FLASH!! Just because the age of consent is 18 in your country, doesn&#39; t make it so everywhere else in the world! 18 is comparatively old by global standards. I believe the average age is 16 (as in my country) and in Italy where the film takes place it&#39; s actually 14. Whether you agree with it morally or not, no criminal act takes place - US law does not apply!<br/><br/>However, I agree with many reviewers that Armie Hammer is miscast in terms of his character&#39; s age. He is 31 and looks it, whereas Oliver is meant to be 24. His age is never referred to in the film, so viewers who haven&#39; t read the book are left with the impression of a 30-ish man engaging in a relationship with a 17-year-old, which Timothee (20 at the time) does convincingly portray. I can fully understand how that would ring alarm bells for many. If they&#39; d had an actor who actually looked 24 I think that would have created a very different dynamic. Even so, the relationship is hardly of a paedophilic nature. And I don&#39; t think most people would regard 17-year-olds as &quot; children&quot; physically and emotionally, even if they may be legally. <br/><br/>Timothee Chalamet gives an incredible performance fully deserving of all the accolades, but I found Armie&#39; s inconsistent at best. He does get better as the film goes along. Maybe it&#39; s just that I didn&#39; t find his character particularly appealing. . . to me he comes across as rather abrupt and arrogant, and weirdly passive-aggressive and patronising towards Elio for much of the time. The physical scenes between Oliver and Elio were excruciatingly awkward to watch and didn&#39; t ring true to me - but I&#39; m a straight female so what would I know? I haven&#39; t had that reaction with the (admittedly few) other gay films I&#39; ve seen though. Maybe it was supposed to reflect real life, or maybe I am just too accustomed to male-female depictions. Ultimately the relationship seemed to consist of Elio being infatuated and Oliver enjoying being the object of that infatuation, rather than a true love story. <br/><br/>Personally the relationship I found most touching in the film was that between Elio and his parents. Although they aren&#39; t given much to work with, both the actors playing his parents do beautiful, nuanced work. . . and the much-lauded scene near the end with his father was stunning and truly moving. It was refreshing to see a such a loving and accepting child-parent relationship, done in a natural and non-affected way. It rang very true to my own experience as an only child and it was nice to see this portrayed on film for once, instead of the tension-filled relationships American films usually depict. <br/><br/>Overall I thought the film was absorbing and well-done, but neither the masterpiece or great love story it&#39; s being hyped as. ",8
"I really wanted to like this film. I read the book when it came out; I am a gay man; I love films about love relationships between beautiful men; I love films with bits of European languages and lovely European settings; I am &#39; pro&#39; art house films which are all about characters and take their time. But this didn&#39; t work. Firstly, it was really too long. But my main problem was that the relationship between Elio and Oliver just didn&#39; t ring true. OK, a few small things happened between them which could have been seen as sexual (e. g. the shoulder massage), but they were both busy doing things with women a lot. Nothing wrong with being bi! And Elio is meant to be young, finding himself etc. But one day, he suddenly says to Oliver that he needs to tell him something, and Oliver says he knows what it is - but there really hasn&#39; t been enough evidence of that building up. I do realise that reading an article about Hammer which said that he had a clause added to his contract restricting the amount of sex and nudity he would be expected to do - well that made me struggle to see sincerity in his acting. Chalumet on the other hand is a great discovery. The way he holds a close-up all through the closing titles, showing a range of emotions, is very impressive indeed. I can remember so clearly what it was like at 17 (OK yes, 50 years ago) to kind of enjoy feeling sad and then elated about love and sex, and Chalumet shows that brilliantly. But he is not enough to save this film, and nor is the man playing his father, who does such an excellent job of channelling Robin Williams. ",5
"The movie overall felt like it is able to depict the very essence of young love. it is able to convey the passion, the rawness, the recklessness that one could face when they&#39; re in love and just discovering themselves without being overall as shove those ideas down the audience&#39; s throats. <br/><br/>The music was magnificent, it was wonderfully crafted, but some of the editing concerning the music in the film, made it felt as if they abruptly dropped everything, and kind of destroyed the mood that they were already setting in their previous scenes. <br/><br/>The cinematography is amazing, it felt very personal, and throughout the whole movie, i felt like the way that they presented the movie have been mostly consistent",9
"I loved &quot; A Bigger Splash&quot; (the previous film by Luca Guadagnino, ) and was in awe by the trailer and stunning reviews for this film. Needless to say, my expectations were utterly shattered by this powerful, emotional, and gorgeous drama. It&#39; s one of the best films of the decade, and clearly the best film of the year so far. <br/><br/>While this isn&#39; t the type of film with too many spoilers, I still don&#39; t want to give too much away. It&#39; s better to go into such a sublime film like this knowing less rather than more. What I will say is that the main plot concerns an adolescent man who is spending a summer in the 1980&#39; s with family in Lombardy, Italy. He begins having a relationship with an older man invited as a guest by the family played by Armie Hammer. The film&#39; s pacing is superb and lets the viewer genuinely meet these characters, who are bonded by both friendship and physical affection. This is clearly shown throughout the movie, as the chemistry between the two leads is excellent. <br/><br/>But what makes &quot; Call Me By Your Name&quot; such a phenomenal film is its gripping sense of feeling. Viewers truly feel that they are away from where they are viewing the film, and truly feel like they have been transported to 1980&#39; s Italy. Guadagnino is a masterpiece at eliciting senses, and the audience&#39; s sense of senses are used to full effect to simulate the true feelings of being in Italy. From luscious depictions of peaches and apricots grown in the countryside, to the streets in gorgeous Italian towns and the steamy espresso, every sight and sound in the film feels truly authentic and impactful on the viewer. I have not seen such an effective use of reflecting on audiences&#39; senses to create a more immersive viewing experience in a film in years. The film&#39; s score is exceptional as well. It feels authentically Italian and beautifully emotional, especially when paired with the film&#39; s script in many scenes. The writing feels both authentic and intelligent at all times, and the film doesn&#39; t even manage to let its guard down in a single scene by failing to grip the viewer with its beautiful script. A late-film monologue by Michael Stuhlbarg is a particular highlight. <br/><br/>As one can see from reading this review, this film is truly unforgettable and a brilliant trip to Italy. Its immersion in its setting and characters remind us of the focal point of cinema: to expose the viewer to unique settings and opportunities and to transport them to these opportunities through the language of film. Recommended to the highest degree. 10/10",10
"This is the kind of film that you see in &#39; Coming Attractions&#39; and you think that though it sounds interesting enough to see, it will never live up to its hype. And still you go see it. And yet, even though you knew the buzz for the film was overblown, you are even more disappointed upon leaving the theater than you were prepared to be. This is sub-mediocre cinema for the pretentious mass of moviegoers. <br/><br/>For one thing, it was way too long, at least a half hour more than necessary. Too many wasted, extended shots that did nothing to advance the paper-thin narrative of Vulnerable Younger Man Elio falls for Manipulative Young Man Oliver, involving themselves in a six-week summer fling with full parental approval. Oliver has his peach and eats it too, then moves back to the United States to proceed with his pre-planned heterosexual lifestyle. Elio is then left to pine and yearn and mourn with a beautiful sad-face through the closing credits. Two hours and ten minutes for this? No thank you, sirs. <br/><br/>About the performances: Armie Hammer is a truly beautiful physical specimen of a man, but in this film that is the full extent of his acting ability. Preening, with an exaggerated sense of dismissive cool, his portrayal of Oliver left the sense of an actor trying too hard to pretend that he was comfortable in the role. This sense is re-inforced in the promotional interviews for the film, where he seems to be working just a bit too hard to show how cool he was with kissing and simulating sex with another beautiful young(er) man. The utter sterility of the sex scenes or the lack of explicit nudity, however, as dictated by Hammer&#39; s contract, belie his overcompensating demeanor. Understandable, perhaps, but this kills the credibility of any emotional chemistry beyond the two men on- screen. <br/><br/>Timothée Chalamet, on the other hand, is remarkable in the way he inhabits his role, with a kittenish physicality, all lean, wiry lines and lithe angles, that more than holds its own in the scenes with Hammer. Despite the unbelievability of any emotional connection between the two characters, Chalamet&#39; s Elio gives a palpable sense of physical attraction to the older Oliver, a man-crush that gives way to physical yearning. The depth of Chalamet&#39; s performance was what carried the film, and was by far the most interesting, successful aspect of the production. <br/><br/>The novel could actually be interesting, but as brought to screen it was diffuse, dissolute, and disparate; like a collage attempting to depict a mosaic of a mural. This film will get praise for dealing with a sensitive subject, and I suppose that is fair enough; I only wish it had been more interestingly and convincingly executed. ",3
"Simply put: the best film I&#39; ve ever seen. This production with a stellar cast and tremendous director and producers have made, through my eyes a perfect film. <br/><br/>The characters are engaging, the emotions are raw and palpable. However, the chemistry between all the actors, are truly magnificent. You can relate, extraordinarily to the characters and the storyline of a first love and the trepidation you feel when telling someone how you feel and not knowing whether that will be reciprocated. <br/><br/>Timothée and Armie have done a tremendous job in depicting honest and raw emotions and feelings and love that translate with audiences of any nationality and transcend barriers like no other film before it. <br/><br/>This is the best film I have ever seen and highly recommend you view. ",10
"I have seldom had such strong, but also mixed feelings about a movie. There were aspects that I disliked, but they were ultimately outweighed by the things that I found absolutely brilliant so I think the rating of 8 is well deserved, especially because movies that handle gay love respectfully are still way too rare. <br/><br/>I think the overall &quot; carpe diem&quot; message of the film was wonderful. I loved and was moved to tears by the monologue by the father in which he tells his son what too many parents would not. I also thought the acting by the boy could not have been better. I have never seen a more impressive and realistic end titles scene than this. I also adore that this movie realistically shows that love is not only beautiful but also true at 17, regardless of age gap. Gay or straight does not really matter. <br/><br/>Where the movie disappointed me is in the way the relationship was built up and how both characters betrayed their own feelings (which rang unreal to me). I understand the struggle of the man to hide his feelings, but very little of that showed. I was also hugely disappointed in the ease by which the man flirted with the girl. I personally find it hard to believe that someone would betray a current love that way. Similarly, I found it unbelievable that the boy would make out with a girl on the very day his dream might come true. And then the way that the man announces his marriage and having had an &quot; on and off&quot; relationship. That ultimately made me feel that the man&#39; s love wasn&#39; t as sincere as the rest of the story made it out to be. And thus that the relationship might have been manipulative after all. <br/><br/>But then again, perhaps that was the objective. . . to show that life flashes by and that even this imperfect beauty is worth every moment and too often shut out. In the end, the movie left me feeling deeply sad. Perhaps especially because it touched home with me, having experienced an impossible love at the same age. ",8
"Ratings here for this movie are a joke. The first 20 ratings are 10 out of 10 with absurdly over the top praise. Really? Someone was paid to write them maybe? or the crew organised a ratings campaign. This movie was above all, slow and boring. I quickly lost all interest in any of the characters. One pointless scene after another. At the time Elio had sex with the peach, I googled the length of the movie and realised there was another 30 minutes of this 132 minutes of tripe to suffer through. I couldn&#39; t face it and four of us walked out. Oh and unless it was in the last 30 minutes, the morality of a much older man fooling around with the 17 year son while staying in the house of his colleague was not addressed? Was this romanticising casual sex with children? Kind of creepy. Not a patch on Brokeback Mountain. Far more interesting, way more depth and nuance, far better acting. ",2
"No story line.
Can&#39; t help but wonder how many people would be writing &quot; Perfection&quot; if it was just a boring hetro couple?
Cinematography and scoring only redeeming features + old mans speech at the end.
Can&#39; t believe I just wasted 2. 5hrs of my life. ",3
"I genuinely do not understand the hype of this Movie. <br/><br/>Armie Hammers Character is supposed to be a 24 year old Grad Student. The man is a solid 31 (Born 1986) who looks to be in his late 30&#39; s, whether that be from costume, or makeup. So to picture either one of them as a young adolescence exploring each others sexuality, is not there. It looks more like an old man trying to (and failing at) seducing a young uninterested boy. <br/><br/>His character should have been recast at the first table reads. Armie Hammer makes Oliver seem like a pretentious showboating creep, and the random acting from happy, to laughing, to dancing in the street, to screaming, t o anger. . . it&#39; s all over the map and it; &#39; s terrible. <br/><br/>The screenwriter should have his Oscar revoked. There was Absolutely no Chemistry between the two main characters, which didn&#39; t help that their dialogue, body language, and facial expressions towards each other was uncomfortable and forced. In the book, the internal dialogue of Elio&#39; s longing for Oliver is rampant, NONE of that is Portraid on screen for the first half of the movie, so when it finally happens, it&#39; s seems so unrealistic and forced. <br/><br/>An example, When Oliver reaches out to Elio to help his shoulder, The actors cringing and pulling away does NOT give the idea that he&#39; s interested, or fighting back emotions he can&#39; t control. He seems to be frankly disturbed by this man touching him. <br/><br/>It also doesn&#39; t help that for the first half hour these two male characters showing their interest in women, from (HORRIBLY) dancing with them, to rendezvous in the water, to dates in the city, to sexual encounters in a field, to a secondary planned out encounter in an attic, NONE of that is any indication that Elio is interested in Oliver, at all!! But they talk to each other in riddles at a war monument and it&#39; s supposed to be believed that they&#39; re talking about a homosexual attraction that Elio has for Oliver. <br/><br/>Can I also mention the forced plot movement, from the mom randomly reading to her husband and 17 year old son about a prince who just doesn&#39; t know how to tell a princess how he feels. . . . or the father and his slides of young desirable men, just beckoning to be touched. . . . to the songs in the car, or alley, about new love. That&#39; s poor writing when you have to dumb down the story so much that you&#39; re TELLING the audience &quot; This is the part in the story where the characters have to tell each other hoe they feel, and this is the part when they&#39; re going to have sex&quot; <br/><br/>And what was with the editing? The cinematographer should give his head a shake. . . . Apparently the scene in which Elio is sitting in the garden and the Music is playing while those blue filters and visible film was from an issue with the physical film of the movie, but it didn&#39; t fit into the movie in any way! Or going from a full orchestra backing to immediate cut to silence to the bizarre jump cuts. . . . <br/><br/>A perfect example of being pulled out of a scene, Oliver and Elio are spinnign and twirling randomly in a field, then on a Mountan, screaming the whole time like idiot children with too much sugar. Then it cuts to a midnight scape in a stone street alley, where they&#39; re twirling on the wall, Oliver randomly runs over to peple, grabs a woman, pulls her to an exact spot and starts dancing with her like a drunk uncle at a Wedding Reception. Then, out of NOWHERE provoked by NOTHING Elio Throws up. We then immediately cut to then kissing, then Oliver naked in a window, with Elio in bed, then a train station. <br/><br/>Where did that come from?! Why did he throw up?? What was with the dancing? Where was the explanation for any of this? Was it just not important enough to be adapted from the book? Did Elio HAVE to throw up?!<br/><br/>The only redeeming factor was the Robin Williams Stand in Father, talking to his son. Which, for a father to be that accepting, in 1983. . . . . Is the most fantastical part of this movie. <br/><br/>The ENTIRE time I watched this movie I wanted to scream out &quot; WHAT IS HAPPENING?! WHAT?! WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?!&quot; I felt like there were ants on my skin as I tried to piece together why SO many people insisted I just HAD to see this movie. I truly do not understand the Hype.

"The word &quot; originality&quot; has been overused, especially by me, so much that it has almost been beaten to a pulp.  After all, how can one really tell if something in a film hasn&#39; t been done before?  Well, I can confidently say that Steven Shainberg&#39; s &quot; Secretary&quot; may be the most inventive, and yes, even original, film this year.  I can confidently say that in all of my time of watching and reviewing films, I have never seen anything like it. <br/><br/>
Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) has just been released from a mental institution due to the fact that she constantly would cut herself when tension started to build up around the household.  After she is released, it is clear that the habit has not been broken, but cuts or no cuts, she needs a job.  She goes to typing school and gets some of the highest grades in her class, making her perfect for the position of secretary at a nearby lawyer&#39; s office.  She goes for the interview, and after seeing the previous secretary run out in tears and hearing the questions in the interview, it is apparent that the lawyer, E. Edward Grey (James Spader), is a bit of a creep. <br/><br/>
Soon enough, Lee begins to cut herself at work, and needless to say, Grey catches her in the act.  He doesn&#39; t take any sort of disciplinary action towards her.  Instead, it seems that he can relate.  He tells Lee, very inspiringly, that she will never cut herself again.  Lee is uplifted, but has no real inclination as to just why he said what he did.  However, she still continues to make mistakes in her writing, and after a while, it simply drives Grey nuts.  He invites her into her office and tells her to &quot; Lean over, put your elbows on the table and read the letter outloud&quot; . She does as he asks, but in a strange turn, he spanks her every other word. She runs into the bathroom hurt and embarrassed, but interestingly enough, she loved it. <br/><br/>I&#39; m a bit surprised that even by this time, there has been little controversy over &quot; Secretary&quot; .  I had images in my head of feminist groups rallying for the film never to reach the screens, or possibly screams of NC-17 from everyone&#39; s favorite censors, the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).  Thankfully though, it&#39; s gotten this far unscathed.  Maybe that is because audiences at preview screenings and film festivals are realizing that although loaded with thick layers of kooky (but not that kinky) S/M, the situation is a deeply and fundamentally human one. <br/><br/>Basically, if S/M was ever shown in a film before, it would usually be in the context of a villain torturing a hero against their will, and usually such scenes weren&#39; t in anything that wasn&#39; t some cheap exploitation film. &quot; Secretary&quot; is a brave endeavor, but it knows where it&#39; s going.  This isn&#39; t a gimmick, S/M sequences in the film are not the least bit perverted (the same can&#39; t be said about some segments in several Larry Clark films). These scenes are essential to understanding the characters. <br/><br/>What is so great about &quot; Secretary&quot; goes beyond its offering insight as to why anyone would find being tied to a pole and spanked while holding a carrot between their teeth even remotely attractive.  Despite pretty morbid subject matter, &quot; Secretary&quot; flies off the screen with energy and wit, offering some of the funniest, most surprising dark comedy I have seen since &quot; Fargo&quot; .  Several scenes in the film have already become classics in my repertoire of movie moments that will stay with me forever, including one hilarious incident involving a worm. <br/><br/>Even with all of this, there is no way that &quot; Secretary&quot; would have pulled it off without Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader.  Spader is creepy and oddly pathetic; his performance is such that at one moment we are sympathetic, the next we are booing him, then we&#39; re intrigued again.  Maggie Gyllenhaal is equally brilliant; she gives us complete access into the mind of Lee Holloway, and it&#39; s close to impossible not to feel for her.  Also, take into account how courageous she is; you try and find me another actress her age who would be willing to do half of the things she does in the film. <br/><br/>Spader and Gyllenhaal have such chemistry that everything clicks. Director Steven Shainberg lets us truly understand the complexities of their relationship without letting the energy lag or any of the subtle comedy fly past the audience.  &quot; Secretary&quot; is invigorating, touching, hilarious, and often all at the same time.  With too many romantic comedies trying too hard to try something new when they are in fact only going backwards, &quot; Secretary&quot; is a truly unique specimen. ",9
"A self abusing mentally unstable girl finds herself a job as a secretary in a law firm owned by mysterious Spader. The two start a kinky relationship and their lives change dramatically in the process. <br/><br/>This is really a beautiful love story. It&#39; s quite unusual subject matter (the nature of their relationship) may cause some viewers to discard the film, which is a shame &#39; cause this film is really nothing but a romantic little story about two people, who feel alienated and alone, who find each other. The need to find a kindred spirit is something we all want, no matter how different we feel we are from the rest. In some ways, the charming ending, when they finally get together, reminded me in some ways of the ending in &quot; An Officer and a Gentleman&quot; . Hope someone will relate to that. <br/><br/>The acting is superb. James Spader is fantastic as the troubled lawyer and Maggie Gyllenhaal is perfect as well. This is a well written, well directed and moving film that is sure to delight all those who are open minded to some unusual twists in an otherwise universal love story. <br/><br/>9 out of 10",9
"Maggie Gyllenhaal deserves an Oscar nomination for her brilliant portrayal of borderline psychotic, self-mutilating Lee Holloway, a former mental institution patient seeking to sustain herself - vocationally and emotionally - in a challenging world where she has few safe harbors.  She comes from a messy family background although that alone can&#39; t explain her illness. <br/><br/>Learning typing, she gets a secretary&#39; s job with lawyer E. Edward Grey (James Spader, who also turns in a first-rate, nuanced performance).  Grey refuses to have any computers in his very smart, expensive law office. Like many lawyers he&#39; s a perfectionist who abhors typographical errors but his obsession with perfection reflects more than an anal personality hitched to a law degree.  His solo practice seems to thrive better than his self-control of a suppressed sexuality, awakened by Maggie at first unknowingly. <br/><br/>This is a film about what many consider to be deviant behavior (sado-masochism and bondage-discipline, not your usual Hollywood romantic fun and games) that most will concur is uncommon in the workplace.  Director Steven Shainberg and his cast - and Gyllenhaal and Spader carry the film, forget the supporting actors - show Lee and Grey&#39; s rocky and developing relationship with candor, without condemnation and without exploitation. The lawyer and his secretary are sexualized in a way few have experienced and those who have don&#39; t talk to folks outside their circle. <br/><br/>This is a black comedy/a black drama.  It either grabs or repels the viewer: there&#39; s no in-between.  The resolution?  Is it realistic or a cop-out?  I&#39; d love to hear from those able to comment from experience on IMDb&#39; s discussion board.  But I have a feeling few will post reactions. <br/><br/>A very different film that I rate 8/10 on a personal scale where I value the deep and tortured acting projecting the absorbing conflict of this sexualized working (initially) relationship. ",8
"Those Gyllenhalls, they sure can act.  Maggie, like her brother Jake, turns in great performances like they&#39; re routine - she makes it look easy.  In &#39; Secretary&#39; , she delivers a layered, complex performance as Lee Holloway, a disturbed young lady who deals with stress by cutting herself - the pain pushes away everything else that&#39; s bothering her. <br/><br/>As she&#39; s released from an institution back into the world, she takes her first job as secretary to lawyer E. Edward Grey, played by James Spader. From then on, the movie explores their relationship and how it affects Lee, taking her from the quiet, self-damaging wallflower into the determined and strong woman she becomes.  <br/><br/>The film&#39; s use of S&amp; M in the relationship between Lee and Mr. Grey makes it a bit controversial, but it&#39; s not really the focus here.  The idea of Lee as the submissive and Mr. Grey as the dominant have little to do with their sexuality and everything to do with their personality issues. <br/><br/>Lee can&#39; t handle extreme emotion without resorting to pain, because she can&#39; t take control of her own life.  What she sees in Mr. Grey is love - absolute love, the likes of which she can&#39; t find with her fiance Peter (Jeremy Davies).   That love allows her to give him the power of her pain - by doing that, she&#39; s finding something worthy to focus on instead of the nothingness of her sewing kit and iodine.  <br/><br/>Mr. Grey, for his part, is a man who can&#39; t deal with anything except in his own ordered, regimented way.  He cares for his orchids but little else, and the steps he takes with Lee open up his wary heart.  He&#39; s slower to develop than she is, and to take the final steps towards a real, lasting relationship, he has to be dragged there by the force of Lee&#39; s own will. <br/><br/>The key to this film - and S&amp; M relationships in general - is that Lee (the submissive) has all the power, not Mr. Grey (the dominant).  She sets the terms by which the relationship will be conducted, seemingly for the first time in her entire life (including the relationships with her family).  Lee finds love and desire in Mr. Grey, and pursues it while healing her own shattered psyche in the process. <br/><br/>Maggie Gyllenhall is luminous here.  She can say more with a facial expression than most can in a Shakespearean soliloquy.  She gives herself completely over to the part, without a wink or a nudge that she&#39; s just kidding, or thinks any part of this is silly.  She becomes Lee Holloway, which is the best compliment you can give an actor.  Spader, for his part, follows in a long string of oddballs, but doesn&#39; t go over the top, as he could have been tempted to do.  This is Maggie&#39; s movie, and he supports it and plays off it well. <br/><br/>Rating: 8/10, based on the strong performance of Maggie Gyllenhall and the character of Lee Holloway, but nocked down due to a poorly-constructed finale that just doesn&#39; t fit with the rest of the film.  Highly recommended. ",8
"WARNING this review contains SPOILERS: <br/><br/>This film is beautiful in so many ways; Maggie&#39; s portrayal of a submissive was just pure delight. She did SUCH an incredible job in every scene involving her and James Spader. I mean the part where he first starts spanking her. . . her eyes. . . they were just so expressive! Even though she didn&#39; t really talk you could totally understand everything that was going on in her head through her eyes. Just beautiful!<br/><br/>And James Spader! wow. . . I&#39; ve always been impressed by his acting and have always found him incredibly attractive and sexy, but after viewing this film. . . I fell completely in love with him all over again. <br/><br/>Even though the movie really centers around Maggie&#39; s character and her battle with sexuality and cutting and what not. . . I found James&#39; character&#39; s battle to be more intriguing and actually bigger. He&#39; s become completely intimate with her and every time he even looks at her he wants to bang the sh*t out of her. So his way of dealing with that is through exercising. And his whole obsessive complusiveness was, well to me, kind of funny. <br/><br/>Some of my most favorite scenes in this film was when James fires Maggie yet she doesn&#39; t want to leave. He sits down in a chair and she comes up to the side of him and starts running her fingers through his hair. The expression on his face while she does that is just so enthrawling! I mean just the touch of her makes him go into an orgasmic bliss! I also love the scene where She is lying naked on the grass and he is rubbing his hand over her stomach touching every cut and scar. And you hear her voice over talking about how she used to be shy about having sex because she didn&#39; t want anyone to see her cuts; she was so ashamed of herself, yet he didn&#39; t care at all about them and loved her for everything she is. She felt beautiful when with him and wasn&#39; t ashamed anymore. It was just fantastik! And my 3rd favorite scene was when James starts kissing maggie and works his way down her body, and while he&#39; s doing this she starts asking him questions like &quot; I wanna know when your first love was, when you had your first kiss, what your favorite color is, where you were born. . . &quot; and he had worked his way back up and stops right above her face and answers her question about where he was born. She then gets this big smile on her face right before he leans closer and kisses her deeply. I don&#39; t care what anyone else says, but that scene had my heart racing a mile a minute, it was so sweet. <br/><br/>Despite all of the things that had happened in the past these 2 found acceptance in each other and because of that will love one another forever. I HIGHLY recommend seeing this film. You will become so attached to it I swear! my rating is 9/10. ",9
"&#39; Secretary&#39; deals with a daring and original subject and does this in an effective and funny way. Its subject is sadomasochism, its genre is a romantic comedy. The secretary is Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal), who suffers from self-mutilation, her boss is Mr. Grey (James Spader), who seems the coldest man alive. When they are in the same room you feel that there is something there, they both feel it too. Since the movie opens with a certain S/M scene we already know that there is a point in the movie where the two must find each other and start the sadomasochism activities. I will not reveal how and when it happens, but the moment is great. <br/><br/>Saying too much about the story would spoil things. We laugh at the right times, which is a good thing. Considering the subject it is even hard to accomplish that since people who are not familiar with it laugh very easy when they see strange things. For most audiences the events will be strange. The original approach of the movie, the performances perfect for this movie, the funny moments and an ending that plays exactly as it should this is a good movie and one of the most original romantic comedies I have seen.

"How refreshing!!  It has been quite some time since I went to the movies and walked out feeling I could wholeheartedly endorse the film I just saw.  When asked why this film was so good by my coworkers, I responded &quot; the actors&#39; performances, the sets, the script, the content, essentially everything. &quot;  And so it is, everything. Thank the spirits that flow someone still has the ability, honesty, and energy to make such a film in the land of fakery and deception. While the relationship depicted is that of a sadist and a masochist and this is what will get played up in the press, the point is the relationship and the near impossibility of love working without complete honesty.  Bravo. ",10
"&quot; Secretary&quot; is everything I have ever wanted in a film: romance, humor, drama, and kinky sex! The incredible chemistry between an amazing Maggie Gyllenhaal and a repressed yet fierce James Spader is what makes this movie work so well, and the tender depths to which their relationship is portrayed makes it so much more than just a film about sadomasochism. I felt that the main theme of the film was to show that people have pain, and it is only when you accept that pain that you are able to feel your emotions fully, therefore making your life much more livable. This movie was a bit quirky, and might not be for everyone. However, I would recommend it to anyone with an open mind. &quot; Secretary&quot; is by far my favorite film of the year. ",10
"I saw this movie twice &amp; want to see it again. . . &amp; again. . . &amp; again. *LOL* I really enjoyed it. At first I thought that it might be too risque for my taste, but I was pleasently surprised. Don&#39; t get me wrong, there is plenty of risque, but it was played out so well that it just blended. I was amazed when I realized that this movie wasn&#39; t ALL about Sub/Dom, but in fact it was a love story. I wasn&#39; t disappointed. I recommend seeing this film if you haven&#39; t already, &amp; even if you have. =)<br/><br/>I am a very big fan of James Spader &amp; he was so amazing in this film. He was beautiful, funny, complex, &amp; sexy. I&#39; ll be his secretary any day. <br/><br/>
I was also surprised by the fact that I liked Maggie Gyllenhaal. She is a very good actress &amp; alot more attractive than in any of the pictures I have ever seen of her. Everyones acting is Superb, the directing superb, &amp; the story *****!!!!!! My raves don&#39; t even do this movie justice. Just go see it!<br/><br/>-M",10
"In this romantic black comedy, Maggie Gyllenhaal stars as Lee Holloway, the lady worker of the title. As you probably already know, this secretary doesn&#39; t just push pens and use paper clips, she has another, more exciting capacity as her boss&#39; s love object. The film actually isn&#39; t quite as naughty as many people think it thinks it is, but the truth is that the sadomasochistic area of the film isn&#39; t really all that important. The film isn&#39; t really about obscure sexual preferences, it&#39; s about finding someone whom you are comfortable with and the S&amp; M is just a means to an end. The sex aspect of the film does serve a purpose, however, in that it&#39; s that which makes the film a social satire of this culture of flirting in the office; a very over the top one, that is, and one that gives the film it&#39; s shock value; but to be honest, you don&#39; t really get to see that much bondage. The film is very original in it&#39; s portrayal of S&amp; M however, as it&#39; s a very taboo subject and for it to be portrayed in a sweet and upbeat manner like this is welcome and very different. <br/><br/>As mentioned, Maggie Gyllenhaal takes the title role and starring opposite her is James Spader as her boss. Gyllenhaal&#39; s character is sweet, inexperienced and bashful. She&#39; s very easy to like, but she can also be annoying at times. Spader&#39; s character is the complete opposite; despite being insecure, he comes across as being cold, calm and collected. He keeps his emotions hidden inside and reveals very little about himself, unlike Maggie&#39; s character who is happy to wear her emotions on her sleeve and doesn&#39; t seem to mind what other people think. Observe the way that the boss continues to tell her to put her shoes on because her feet stink etc; not exactly the most conscientious person to ever walk the earth. Despite being chalk and cheese, however, the two characters blend together in a way that is both believable and interesting, and this makes for some great chemistry between the two leads that is hard not to enjoy. The fact that they are chalk and cheese is a help and not a hindrance to the film as it serves in making it all the more interesting. My only quibble with the characterization is the ending, which although it brings the message out, seems tacked on and rather unrealisticbut it&#39; s not enough to spoil the film. <br/><br/>Overall, Secretary is not a masterpiece, but it is a very good portrayal love, and one that is far superior to dull and dreary films such as &#39; Lost in Translation&#39; . It&#39; s entertaining for it&#39; s duration, there are several funny moments and the central message, which states that it&#39; s worth going to extremes for the one you love is a worthwhile one for any movie, even if it is someone lost under the premise of the movie. Recommended. ",7
"What a fantastic movie. It must be the sexiest movie I&#39; ve ever seen and it actually has a story! <br/><br/>There was little nudity but the eroticism is created by the long slow build ups. When Lee is unable to get Edward&#39; s attention you feel her frustration, and this makes his decision to give in to her a much bigger pay-off. <br/><br/>I disagree with a lot of the reviewers about the ending being trite - I think the cheesy, white picket fence style conclusion serves to prove to any doubters that a sub/dom relationship isn&#39; t in any way distasteful or abnormal, that it&#39; s perfectly possible to indulge in non-vanilla sex and live a normal happy life. <br/><br/>And if you&#39; ve ever worked as a secretary, then you&#39; ll identify with many of the scenes. The sad thing is that IRL when your boss doesn&#39; t help you put a water bottle in the cooler or asks you to retrieve something from the rubbish it&#39; s not because he&#39; s secretly lusting after you, it&#39; s because he&#39; s an unhelpful git. And he won&#39; t look like James Spader. Dammit. ",10
"Good to see a mainstream movie showing consensual BDSM in a positive light for once, without references to serial killers or abuse (which have nothing whatever to do with consensual BDSM).  Well done to all who made it. ",10
"Mainstream Movie Makers: Watch here. <br/><br/>Here you can see that you donot need to pay 1 or 2 Million bucks per minute to make a good film. En contraire. All you need is excellent actors, a super story book and splendid dialogs - and people who really do like to make movies, not money. Seldom you get a better inside look into peoples habits and wishes as here. And never you feel guilty for that, never you think: What kind of people do act or behave like this? Congratulations. ",10
"this film enthralled me from beginning to end. i was afraid it would be another exercise about counselling r us, angst, and feminist apologies. something more like LOVE CRIMES. the heroine is exquisite, and if i didnt know better, i would guess that she knew all about that unbelievable look on her face. and i&#39; ve always been a big fan of james spader, who doesnt seem to have an ego when he chooses a role. i&#39; m going to watch this one again. and again. ",10
"This dark, romantic comedy is both touching and inspirational. Maggie Gyllenhaal&#39; s transformation from timid, self-mutilating mouse to sensual, self-confident woman is amazingly poignant. With a minimum of dialogue, both Gyllenhaal and James Spader (who plays her boss) are able to convey volumes. I walked out of the theater feeling both exhilarated and optimistic. Expect great things from Maggie Gyllenhaal in the future, and thanks to the director for coaxing such a multidimensional and compelling heartbreaking performance from James Spader. I hope you like it. . . ",10
"This somewhat hidden gem has just made it to my list of all-time favorites. Before yesterday, I had forgotten that it existed until someone recommended it to me. <br/><br/>Terrific, the acting, lighting, set, dialogue and story kept me captivated throughout and I think I had a smile on my face (not because it was funny, but because I was REALLY enjoying it) all the way through it. <br/><br/>I was grateful that there was not a lot of &quot; sex&quot; and nudity in this film because it would have taken away from what the subject matter was all about. <br/><br/>
A terrific performance by Spader. He never ceases to amaze me. <br/><br/>I don&#39; t give this kind of rating to too many films, but this one got a 10. ",10
"Clearly, most of the people that thought this movie was genius were more titillated than anything. Yes, it&#39; s taboo. Yes it&#39; s intriguing. But it never really materialized in a smooth manner. I did appreciate the fact that the S and M stuff was introduced in a way that didn&#39; t insult the audience, taking the viewers seriously and insinuating they knew what this was all about. But for those that didn&#39; t understand, the film was pretty dull. <br/><br/>Sadly, the film just didn&#39; t take the subject far enough. While the progression of pleasure gathered by the characters was quite effective, a lot of little annoyances just kept getting in the way. Maggie Gyllenhaal&#39; s mental illness was too overplayed in the second half of the film, and then hokie moments like her pleasuring herself in the bathroom and the big crowds outside the lawyers&#39; office really kind of knocked the film out of its continuous dark turn. In the hands of a more capable writing-directing team, this film would be pretty good. But with it already made, we&#39; ll have to stuck with this film until something better comes along. ",4
"This is one of my favorite films. . . everything about it is beautiful. The directing and cinematography were outstanding!!! And the story. . . very touching. <br/><br/>I feel this film does a wonderful job of showing people that in a sado-masochistic relationship there still lies the basic principles of all relationships. There is love, understanding, affection and above all dedication. <br/><br/>I also feel it brings the viewers to a greater understanding of why people choose to live these lifestyles. It helps them to understand some of the reasoning behind sadism and masochism. <br/><br/>The story of two people in a alternative lifestyle couldn&#39; t have seemed more natural or more loving than it did in this movie. Spectacular!",10
"I&#39; m a Conservative, Straight guy, but this movie tugged hard at my heartstrings. The acting of the three principal players was exceptional throughout the entire film.
The storyline was completely believable and powerful. I don&#39; t want to say too much about the plot, but I really emphasized with the players.
The love shown was real and palpable. That is significant. ",8
I can feel the warmth in the chemistry between Anna Paquin and Holliday Grainger. Two lonely and sad characters finding happiness in each other. The movie was better than expected. And the message and narrative are still relevant today. Because lesbian relationships are still frowned upon in some societies. ,7
"Tell it to the Bees plays like a grittier Scottish version of &quot; Carol&quot; . <br/><br/>It&#39; s 1952 (&quot; Carol&quot; was also set in 1952, but in New York). Many married men have come back from the war forever changed. Life is financially tough for most families. In particular, attitudes to multi-racial relationships and (particularly) homosexuality are appalling, and never more so than in the small Scottish mill town where the film is set. <br/><br/>Holliday Grainger plays Lydia, separating from her rough and ready war-veteren husband Robert (Emun Elliott). This is all really hard for 7-year old Charlie (Gregor Selkirk) who without sexual guidance from either parent or school is trying to make sense of his world. Charlie is a sensitive child and finds solace by talking to the bees kept by local doctor Jean Markham (Anna Paquin) where she lives alone in the large family home. &quot; You should tell the bees your secrets. Then they won&#39; t fly away. &quot; Jean tells the young lad. <br/><br/>As Lydia&#39; s circumstances change, she and Jean grow ever closer and scandal is set to envelope the community. <br/><br/>The story comes from a book by Fiona Shaw (the the action moved from Yorkshire to Scotland) and the screenplay is by Henrietta and Jessica Ashworth. Just as in &quot; Carol&quot; the film deliciously builds (if that&#39; s not too lascivious a thing to say) the sexual tension that grows between the two women. <br/><br/>But aside from this main love story there are some beautifully crafted sub-stories in there. One in particular, featuring Lydia&#39; s cousin Annie Stock (Lauren Lyle) leads to a truly nightmarish scene that will upset some viewers. <br/><br/>An issue I personally found with the Scottish setting is that (like &quot; Under the Skin&quot; ) much of a dialogue is delivered in a very strong regional accent. This made understanding the dialogue for non-Scots very difficult: I had a particular problem with Emun Elliott in this regard. (Sorry if this comment upsets any Scots reading this: it&#39; s just a statement of fact!). <br/><br/>Anna Paquin holds the current record for the youngest-ever Oscar winner (&quot; Best Supporting Actress&quot; in 1993 for &quot; The Piano&quot; ), but here proves she hasn&#39; t lost her touch. Because, here she is both determined and vulnerable in equal measure and acts this out brilliantly. Paired with the free-spirited Holliday Grainger they make for a powerhouse performance together, and the sex scene (when it comes) is wonderfully realised: genuinely sensual, but in more of a 50&#39; s way than for similar scenes in films like &quot; Desert Hearts&quot; or &quot; Blue is the Warmest Colour&quot; . <br/><br/>A late scene on a railway platform - although somewhat clichéd - is an acting masterclass, and memorably done. <br/><br/>Also noteworthy is young Gregor Selkirk in what is his 2nd feature film role. Many of the scenes live or die on this young man, and he does a great job. <br/><br/>This is a small but beautifully crafted film that kept me enthralled. I&#39; m not sure it necessarily needed the bees (some beautiful macro photography by Bartosz Nalazek) but as a simple tale of prejudice in a small community it was well told and delivered the goods. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film. . . so it comes with my recommendation. &quot; Pride&quot; made you appreciate just how far tolerance has come in the UK in 30 years. But &quot; Tell it to the Bees&quot; illustrates that the 80&#39; s were just a step along a journey that started long before that. <br/><br/>(For the full, graphical review please visit One Mann&#39; s Movies on the internet or Facebook.

"Don&#39; t get me wrong, I did like this film. The fashion style and the two main actresses don&#39; t disappoint. However, I&#39; m not sure why they chose to diverge so much from such a well done book and the happy ending of it? The departure from the flow of the book made the last half hour feel clunky. ",7
"A very nice romantic movie. The plot was nothing original, but had some good moments. Glad it had a happy ending which is not very often in LGBT themed movies. I wished to see Jean and Lydia reunite though. Still, a happier ending than expected. ",8
"Greetings again from the darkness. Secrets and lies become a tangled web of messiness that impacts lives and relationships in this story adapted from Fiona Shaw&#39; s 2009 novel. Annabel Jankel (known for her music videos and as a creator of Max Headroom) directs the script from sisters Henrietta and Jessica Ashworth, and we learn that this rural community in 1952 Scotland is filled with judgmental and close-minded folks unable to accept that some don&#39; t live and love according to society&#39; s general rules of the time. <br/><br/>Holliday Grainger (&quot; The Borgias&quot; ) stars as Lydia, mother to young Charlie (Gregor Selkirk), and the two have recently been abandoned by husband -father Robert (Emun Elliott). Charlie is a sensitive boy - in touch with nature, and observant to his mother&#39; s emotional strains. After a schoolyard scuffle, Charlie is treated by the town&#39; s new doctor, Dr. Markham (Anna Paquin, &quot; True Blood&quot; ), who not only treats his bruises, but also teaches him about the bees and hives in her garden. She lets him know that telling your secrets to the bees keeps them from flying away. <br/><br/>Dr. Markham has returned to the community where she grew up, and the rumors of her teenage years have not faded. Her father recently passed and she has returned to her roots to take his place as the local doctor. When Lydia gets sacked at the factory where she works (by Kate Dickie&#39; s Pam, her spinster sister-in-law/supervisor), Dr. Markham hires Lydia as a housekeeper and invites her and Charlie to move into the house left to her by her father. <br/><br/>&quot; This town is too small for secrets&quot; is not simply a line of dialogue, but easily could have been the title of the films. As Charlie tells his secrets to the bees, Lydia and Dr. Markham grow closer . . . creating confusion for Charlie, challenges for the two women, and disgust within the community. Robert is a brut of a man, and threatens Lydia in every way a simple man might. There is also a subplot around Lydia&#39; s younger sister-in-law Annie (Lauren Lyle), who is pregnant from a secretive interracial relationship. What follows is a vicious response from the close-minded folks previously mentioned. <br/><br/>An older Charlie is our narrator, and most of the story is told from his point of view. Secrets kept by children are contrasted by those of adults, and it&#39; s clear that both cause harm. The first part of the movie is beautifully filmed, though the story structure wobbles a bit in the second half. There are many fascinating close-ups of bees and hives, although a mystical/supernatural sequence is difficult to buy. Excellent acting is on display throughout, especially by young Gregor Selkirk and Ms. Grainger, whose face the camera loves. The film is quite tastefully done, and focused as much on the small-minded town folks reaction as the blossoming relationship between the two leads. A stronger third act would have elevated the film, though the first half hour is well done. ",6
"The director draws excellent performances from the two female leads (playing Lydia and Dr Jean) and also from the very capable supporting cast. The cinematography and production design capture the ambience and restrictive social mores of the &quot; small&quot; 1950s Scottish mill town quite convincingly. The story is less convincing about the symbolism of the bees (which is presumably derived from the book). We see too many random extreme close-ups of bees, Lydia&#39; s son Charlie sharing his secrets with the bees in their hives, and in the last 20 minutes of the movie, an incident which implies that the bees have developed some sort of preternatural relationship with the boy. This latter aspect, particularly, seems rather incongruous with the otherwise quite adult themed lesbian romance story. It strikes me as a movie primarily to be enjoyed for its great character acting. ",7
"So many lost opportunities here. . . Holliday Grainger was the best part of this film. Really read the book, it doesn&#39; t disappoint. ",5
"I would like to answer &quot; SadnessNeverGoes&quot; who in 139 words, 8 punctuations and no capital letters whatsoever ecxept the first word &quot; Is&quot; , gave it a 2. Are you liveing in the same time as me ?
It might not be a masterpiece - I read the book, and it contained much more of the reality of the times, but the film also contains an awareness that the book lacked. I liked it. I did not like &quot; SadnessNeverGoes&quot; . ",7
"Not sure what all the hate is about! I thought the book was way more depressing then the movie. Both actresses portrayed the characters well, and I really ended up enjoying the movie. The ending wasn&#39; t as sad as I was anticipating after reading all the comments on it. Of course I wish Jean went with her, or at the very least they left it that they were going to meet up in a few months. But, that was a way better ending then if she went back with her husband or if one of them died. Overall I give it like a 7/10. ",10

"Charlie is a young boy trying to understand the world. His father Robert Weekes (Emun Elliott) is a brutal man who has abandoned him and his mother Lydia (Holliday Grainger). Charlie befriends Jean Markham (Anna Paquin) who keeps bees in her yard. She had recently returned home after her father&#39; s death. She&#39; s a woman&#39; s doctor and a lesbian which must be kept secret back then in a small village. When Lydia and Charlie get evicted, they move in with Jean. Slowly, Jean succumbs to Lydia and the secret cannot be kept hidden. <br/><br/>Charlie is a problem. His turn is a problem. It&#39; s hard to understand his action when the movie doesn&#39; t seem to know him either. It needs to be set up better. His motivation is like a swarm of bees. It&#39; s hard to know which one is important and which one is not. Does he like his father? He fears being taken away but he&#39; s running away. Does he expect his family to be reunited? He&#39; s obsessed with secrets but what exactly does he know? What does he understand about love or sex? He doesn&#39; t seem to know and the movie is unable to specify his understanding. It may help to have an even younger actor in the role which would excuse his confusion. There is also the matter with the bees. It&#39; s a magical premise but the movie does not have the surreal magic needed to pull it off. While I appreciate the intended message, the movie never strays away from preaching its views. This could work but Charlie is a problem. ",5
"Spoilers are contained henceforth. <br/><br/>Let me start by saying it&#39; s not all bad. There are some pretty decent actors in this film but they have been cast as one dimensional plot movers rather than real people. <br/><br/>The story is one of forbidden love between two damaged women, just after the second world war in a small village. What unfolds is a masterclass in using every trope and cliche ever invented to drag you through the film. We have weird furtive glances, baths with doors open, hands that slip into naughty places by accident. . .
We also have a evil mean husband used to further the storyline, his scowly mother and the bright and forward thinking sister who &quot; gets what&#39; s coming to her&quot; . <br/><br/>Anna Paquin has the oddest expressions in the film and none of them match the emotions she should be feeling. In fact, her face looked like it was made of plasticine most of the time - sort of squishy and in odd grimaces. <br/><br/>The leads had negative chemistry. I have more going on with the woman on the tills in Asda and we simply talk about how many bags for life I want. We&#39; d have a more believable relationship than these two. <br/><br/>If you manage to make it to the end in one piece (ie, without clawing your own face off), you&#39; ll be delighted to know the end makes no sense, doesn&#39; t follow the book at all, and makes you wish you&#39; d taken a Dulux tester pot to your walls and watched it dry instead. <br/><br/>This film is everything that&#39; s wrong with lesbian filmmaking and squandered BFI funding<br/><br/>2 stars because I liked the bees and costumes. ",2
"I wanted to like this; rarely do filmmakers sensitively portray romance between women and not for the male gaze. But it suffers from the same issues we saw in lesbian movies of the past: the development just wasn&#39; t quite there for the characters, every possible tired theme from lesbian films is thrown at us, including the ending, which frankly, bothers me to no end because it makes NO sense. I can&#39; t help but think there is an underlying homophobic conspiracy to pretty much every &quot; lesbian&quot; film. I&#39; m just plain sick of it. Seriously, is there a master class taught to every director and producer in how to make a lesbian film crash and burn to discourage women from entering into relationships together?<br/><br/>The acting is okay, but not quite at the level I expected. Anna Paquin straight up fumbles during the romantic scenes (fine, we can buy that she&#39; s scared and shy as her character would be? Except she&#39; s the more experienced one with women according to the plot. . . hmmmm) but she legit doesn&#39; t know where on the other actor&#39; s face to kiss, looking like she wants to swallow her face whole. The intimate scene also has the feel of a scene between two actors who really don&#39; t want to do this part; no chemistry and just oddly executed. It was so awkward that it was hard to watch. <br/><br/>The boy&#39; s view and storyline with the bees. . . . a little hokey and not executed quite as well, either. This just isn&#39; t going to be up to your expectations if you want more than tropes. <br/><br/>Try Between Two Women instead: set in working class England in the 1950s (mother and her artistically-gifted son and his teacher), understated and well made, nostalgic, and doesn&#39; t follow the same formula as many lesbian films do.

Not happy but ok? Now in reading the book peopy said book has haooy ending,9
"Fiona Shaw&#39; s novel has been adapted for the screen by Henrietta Ashworth and Jessica Ashworth and as directed by Annabel Jankel the result is a luminous and tender visit to the mid 1950s Scotland, and an examination of the homophobia made even more stressful with the impact of the end of WW II returning mind-damaged soldiers. <br/><br/>Single mother Lydia Weekes (Holliday Grainger) who is abandoned by her husband Robbie (Emun Elliott), meets the small village&#39; s Doctor Jean Markham (Anna Paquin) who has recently returned to her hometown after her father&#39; s death, leaving her a spacious home she cherishes, when Lydia&#39; s son Charlie (Gregor Selkirk) is taken to the doctor after being bullied in school. Charlie grows to see Lydia as his best friend, sharing her fascination with the bees she shelters in her backyard. When Lydia and Charlie are evicted because Lydia&#39; s earnings from her work are not adequate to pay the rent, Jean invites them to stay in her home and she and Lydia soon develop a friendship and something more. The village frowns harshly on Jean and Lydia&#39; s lesbian relationship and Jean&#39; s medical status is threatened until she salvages a botched home-abortion, regaining her respect as a physician. Pending the threat of losing her son to the abusive Robbie, Lydia and Charlie depart the village - with plans to return - to Jean and true family. <br/><br/>The fine musical score by Claire M Singer and cinematography by Bartosz Nalazek add to the impact of this sensitive, very well acted film, and the result is a beautifully delivered romance that manages to survive against all odds. Recommended. ",10
"I ran across this film on line, and being a fan of Anna Paquin, I looked into it. A passionate story; a subject that likely was very taboo in the early 1950s, and still even today in many circles. <br/><br/>I won&#39; t go into the synopsis, read all the other reviews if you need to; I&#39; ll just say that right after seeing it, I got the book from my local library, and read the story in print. Any book is limited when taken to the screen (well, maybe The Hobbit and Rings trilogy broke that mold), so getting all the details in the book onto screen is unlikely. That said, yes, there are significant differences in character development; and the ending has been mentioned frequently. I&#39; ll just combine the two into the story that fits nicely today. <br/><br/>Check this film out; I see it made next to nothing, probably never made it to U. S. theaters, and perhaps was a limited release/direct-to-streaming? But it&#39; s well acted, and thoroughly enjoyable. ",8
"First of all you might understand feelings of both of this two women. Lydia and Jean faced same situation in their lives. like both of them lost their love, protection and sex. due to their loneliness, i think that&#39; s why they build up a this kind of relationship against the convention. at the end, Charlie told us that &quot; Buzz of change&quot; changed the lives of his Mother and Jean.
Sound effects of this movie is quite fascinating, plot is heart touching. hope you will enjoy this movie!",10
"I hate romantic comedies. I detest them. You can list the actors I avoid watching: Hugh Grant, Sandra Bullock, Richard Gere, Julia Roberts. Romantic comedies make me cringe and I avoid them like the plague so you can imagine the foul mood I was in when I was forced to watch this film. <br/><br/>And the introductory voice-over by Hugh Grant as we watch an airport full of people hugging made me want to commit an act of violence - either against the people who forced me to watch this film or against myself just to end the torture. <br/><br/>Then the most unbelievably shocking thing happened. Bill Nighy and Gregor Fischer came on screen, mocking one of the most hated love songs in Britain, &quot; Love is all Around&quot; and I found myself getting sucked into the film. <br/><br/>By the time I reached the end of the film I found myself facing the impossible, there was one romantic comedy out there that genuinely is a comedy and actually likeable. No-one was more shocked than I. <br/><br/>Many different kinds of love are covered (although not all kinds), there&#39; s 8 storylines and the biggest cast list I&#39; ve seen in a long time. Somehow, it works. You&#39; d think it wouldn&#39; t, I know I certainly didn&#39; t. <br/><br/>
If you&#39; re looking for a full-length story, this is not the film for you. It snap-shots the important events leading to the resolution of the couples involved, nothing more. If you want a classic romantic film, this might not be the film for you. This is funnier than most straight comedies I&#39; ve seen in recent times, however (I&#39; m just as harsh a critic of comedy films as I am of romantic films). <br/><br/>It&#39; s not trying to be the meaning of life, it&#39; s not trying to look at the big picture. In fact, it&#39; s only trying to do one thing, and that&#39; s say positive feelings crop up in the most unexpected places or are more prevalent than people think. One of the storylines, one that is cited constantly in reviews as one of the failed storylines with a sad ending is actually bittersweet. It doesn&#39; t end with failure but the failure of one type of love in favour of a different kind. <br/><br/>This film isn&#39; t perfect, I&#39; ll never find the perfect romantic-comedy because I hate the genre so much, for example, one of the storylines did annoy me intensely and yet ironically still made me laugh in places. However, the flaws in the film are vastly outweighed by positives. It&#39; s superficially complicated but is really a very simple film.  It makes a statement: &quot; love actually is all around&quot; then shows why it makes that statement and doesn&#39; t attempt to do or be anything else. <br/><br/>And like the fact it covers different kinds of love, it covers different attitudes and portrayals of it - so a couple are realistic, a couple are classic fantasy, a couple are pure comedy and a couple are pure rom-com tradition. <br/><br/>I have seen no reviewer give this film a middle-of-the-road review, and I&#39; ve read many reviews. I think, in the end, Love Actually is up to the individual. It&#39; s like Marmite. You either love it or you hate it. <br/><br/>Speaking as a cynical, misanthropic, Marmite-hating, Romantic-Comedy hating member of the human race, I actually liked Love Actually. ",9
"It has been a long time since I have seen a movie so rich in character that I did not want it to end. Love Actually is not a love story, it is a story about love. Love that reinvents itself, multiplies itself, opens itself up, and even devastates. <br/><br/>I am sure the film has its critics who say it drips in buttery corn. But when you are able to retreat inward and let it take you over, it is impossible not to feel. It is a rare treat - a film that makes you feel. During the process I was sad and happy and relieved. I was turned on, turned off, dizzy and grounded. <br/><br/>I was in love one time and it reminded me of that. The power of cinema can be that amazing, it can be that intense. The title of the movie is, perhaps, meant to confuse. Yet I believe it is designed to ask. Love Actually is . . . what?<br/><br/>Is it lust? Or a deep appreciation of the past? Can it be conquered by language or political barriers? Race? Infidelity? Age? Can it be all of the above plus more? Maybe a mingling of several?<br/><br/>It is rare for a film of great acting to be married to a terrific script. Yet it is something else for it to speak right to the audience; not talk at them, not try to sell them a film. Let them experience the film. Let it wash over them little by little until there is nothing more of them left. <br/><br/>**** (A)",10
"What I appreciated most about Love Actually was that for the most part, it realistically looks at relationships happy and sad, successful and unsuccessful, with a future and without.  It addresses different forms and levels of love, sometimes straightforward and carefree, sometimes complex and contradictory.  There are schmaltzy happy moments and touching sad ones, moments of great strength and moments of foolish weakness.  The movie is made up of many threads, and of course some threads are stronger than others. <br/><br/>The most interesting parts of Love Actually are the times when it addresses the tragic situations where love is self-sacrificing, contradictory, or fragile.  One character&#39; s unrequited love is revealed as a noble sacrifice made for another&#39; s happiness (the method of finally achieving closure and moving on, however, could only work in the movies).  Another character is shown to be caught between conflicting duties that will, we are led to believe, prevent her from ever being truly happy.  And the strength that a third shows when love is shown to be fragile and her world collapses around her is tragically inspiring. <br/><br/>These noble, tragic threads are interwoven with lighthearted comedic ones to produce a fabric that holds together well.  While some characters have to fight for their love, others have simple, happy, straightforward relationships, with love (or whatever) falling in their laps like a parcel from Santa Claus.  And the purely comic moments, like Rowan Atkinson&#39; s appearances and Hugh Grant&#39; s Christmas-caroling bodyguard, are delightful in and of themselves. <br/><br/>There are of course plenty of nits to pick.  Hugh Grant doesn&#39; t make a very believable Prime Minister, and even his very pointed speech to his American counterpart -- especially relevant in light of Bush&#39; s recent state visit to England -- don&#39; t redeem the odd casting.  Others in this forum have commented on the number of fat jokes in the film, and while I agree, I feel I should point out that the entire point of the first such joke is that the character who has fallen for the &quot; fat&quot; girl clearly doesn&#39; t think of her as fat, and doesn&#39; t understand at first who the other is talking about. It&#39; s true that calling her fat is ridiculous; she&#39; s only large in comparison to Keira Knightley, who must be carrying some vital organs around in her handbag because there&#39; s certainly not enough room in her torso!  But that one time would have been enough; the &quot; fat&quot; theme gets tiresome later on in the movie.  I also agree with those who have said that much of the nudity is completely unnecessary to the plot, and that at least some of the comedic threads in the movie are formulaic and unoriginal. <br/><br/>In the end, I feel that Love Actually is for the most part a thoughtful and entertaining look at relationships, which does not shy away from taking the bad with the good.

"This was a lovely script, and I was surprised I hadn&#39; t heard much about this movie before I caught it on HBO. I turned it on to keep myself company while working and ended up glued to the screen. I really enjoyed it. <br/><br/>The movie is a series of vignettes about several different people that seemingly have no connection to one another, although by the end the connections are finally all present and accounted for. There&#39; s a fair amount of subtle satire and a generous portion of irony; the characters are quite human and often don&#39; t do the right thing. I was caught off-guard by the incredibly successful results of the trip to America, but I laughed pretty hard and decided I wouldn&#39; t have written the script any other way. Not everyone ends up getting what they want, but then again that&#39; s love, er, actually. Nice little film. ",8
"It made me laugh, it made me cry, it made me smile, hug everyone, tell everyone how much I loved them!!! I think the music is the true soul of this movie. Cheers for the director!!! So many beautiful films he&#39; s been doing for so long!!! There was no need of marvelous photography, neither splendorous costume. . . but every detail was placed perfectly. Excellent actors and performances. It was a very good combination of experienced ones and some others one had never seen before. I liked very much how the director showed how open minded the English people are, by the way Liam Neeson talked to Sam and some other aspects on other dialogues as well (related to sex) It is remarkable also the way they mention the American society. Not criticizing the people and the culture, buy yes the government. CONGRATULATIONS ENGLAND!!!!",10
"Any picture that can have me rooting for Rowan Atkinson (who I usually detest as Bean, actually) has to be very well-crafted for my part. . . <br/><br/>Rowan was the Angel Of Conscience in the film he helped the son of the just-widowered Liam Neeson&#39; s character by pass Customs to pursue true love of a little school-mate who happened to be a fine young Afro-American girl(this was where love did not know Race. . . Color-Blind), but he did everything to make Alan Rickman as the publisher think twice before he effed up his marriage for a bit of materialistic fluff! (The gift-wrapping sequence in the department store was annoying, hilarious and Bean-esque all at the same time w/o conflicting. . Amazing!!)<br/><br/>Bill Nighy as the old rocker who discovered platonic love was marvelous; Hugh Grant (brother of Rickman&#39; s wife in the flick) as the goofy good PM who effed up Billy Bob Thornton&#39; s &quot; Bushy&quot; prez was superb and I liked the girl from EastEnders as his love interest, it shows true love knows no class! Love knows no language was shown in Colin Firth&#39; s attraction to his Portuguese assistant when recovering from Romance betrayed - another aspect of love, actually. . . <br/><br/>Kiera Knightley and her weird triangle was a great twist, I thought the white guy had a crush on her husband not her! Ten stories linked in the weirdest ways and showing that love is Universal! As for the tunes, they were sublime and it was weird to see Bill Nighy&#39; s send-up really did do well in the UK Xmas charts! The Power of Love, actually!",10
"In London, from five weeks before Christmas up to a month after Christmas, the lives of different persons are linked by love. The Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) and the member of his household, Natalie (Martine McCutcheon); his sister Karen (Emma Thompson), her husband Harry (Alam Rickman) and Harry&#39; s secretary, Mia (Heike Makatsch); Harry&#39; s employees, Sarah (Laura Linney), a woman with a serious problem in her life, and the designer Karl (Rodrigo Santoro); the writer Jamie Bennett (Colin Firth) and his Portuguese maid Aurélia (Lúcia Moniz); the grieving widow Daniel (Liam Neeson) and his son, Sam; a porn actress and her colleague; the singer Billy Mack (Billy Nighy) and his manager; the just married couple Peter (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and Juliet (Keira Knightley) and their best man Mark (Andrew Lincoln); a British young man that travels to USA, trying to score women in that country. <br/><br/>&quot; Love Actually&quot; is a delightful homage to love. There are different situations, some of them dramatic, others funny, sometimes touching but never corny. The interconnection of the stories has a perfect timing. The cast is a constellation, highlighting the shining beauty of Keira Knightley and the nice role of Hugh Grant. There are many wonderful moments, such as the collective interview of the Prime Minister and the American president; or the moment when Karen finds that her Christmas gift is a CD of Joni Mitchell; or when Mark declares his secret love for Juliet; or the relationship of Daniel and Sam; or when Daniel meets Carol; or when the manager of Billy makes a comment about Elton John; or the narration in off in the beginning of the movie. I believe I could list many other magnificent moments, but better off the reader of my review rent or buy the DVD and have a good time. My vote is nine. <br/><br/>Title (Brazil): &quot; Simplesmente Amor&quot; (&quot; Simply Love&quot; )",9
"Love Actually is movie that helps you see how life redefine&#39; s it self. <br/><br/>Common and extraordinary lives are mixed together with such good taste that you tend to believe that you were probably wrong the last time you were angry because of someone else doings. <br/><br/>The cast gave us outstanding performances by Hugh Grant, Liam Neesom and Emma Thompson and characters (the rock star and his manager are just persons to love!). <br/><br/>Special chapter for the charming Keira Knightley that just have away herself. . . and that is to say probably a person very similar to the general and popular idea of what angel&#39; s are. <br/><br/>A movie just perfect to believe in love again. ",10
"I had expected from this film a relatively undistinguished, harmless little romantic comedy. What instead unfolded was two-plus hours of the most unremitting, insulting, film clichés imaginable. <br/><br/>The film consists of nine simultaneously-running subplots. Each subplot manages to be absurdly implausible, yet predictable at every turn. Among the worst: <br/><br/>One tracked a geeky fellow who was convinced that the way to turn his romantic life around was to impress American girls with his English accent. Each scene of that plot consisted of something like the following: <br/><br/>&quot; I&#39; m going off to the US, where the chicks will think I&#39; m a coolly sophisticated Brit!&quot; <br/><br/>(His friend): &quot; You&#39; re crazy!&quot; <br/><br/>&quot; California girls here I come!&quot; <br/><br/>&quot; Stop!&quot; <br/><br/>And so on. <br/><br/>And on. <br/><br/>In the &quot; payoff&quot; scene, at film&#39; s end, he does, in fact, bag three hot American girls in a bar. Why this scene was worth endless repetition along the way is a mystery. <br/><br/>Another similarly repetitive plot involved two people performing together in a porn film. They strike up a conversation and start forming a tentative relationship. The &quot; joke&quot; is that these strangers are being sexually intimate, yet are acting like awkward teenagers as they stumble their way to going out on a date. They&#39; re porn stars, but they&#39; re shy! Isn&#39; t that funny? Ho ho ho! This might have an amusing one-five-minute-scene joke, but this film stretches into a film-long subplot, complete with the male rejoicing over getting a good-night kiss from his new love. Barf. <br/><br/>Perhaps the worst one involved Colin Firth. Betrayed early in the film, he&#39; s heartbroken. He is assigned a non-English-speaking housekeeper, whom it takes exactly two seconds to discern will be his romantic salvation. <br/><br/>This subplot builds to a supposedly climactic scene where he, with a big crowd in tow, descends upon a restaurant where she works, to propose marriage. He awkwardly declares his love, shots of all of the other diners looking confused and expectant, she says yes, then everyone breaks out in applause and there isn&#39; t a dry eye to be found. Argh. <br/><br/>This film didn&#39; t even bother to construct a buildup to this climactic moment. The two characters have barely a few verbal exchanges prior to this scene. <br/><br/>And the film uses all of the other clichés: her brusque Mediterranean father in the crowd, her sister egging her on, etc. None of these people were actually developed characters. They are just insulting stereotypes thrown in for the final set piece. <br/><br/>In another subplot, Hugh Grant plays a newly elected British Prime Minister. He doesn&#39; t bother to act differently from the way he normally does, the same stammering, yet somehow debonair, Hugh Grant character that he always plays. <br/><br/>He walks in off the street to 10 Downing, and is introduced to his staff, one of whom, again, can immediately be identified as his eventual love interest. Power Prime Minister falls for humble servant girl -- how romantic! Who would have thought?<br/><br/>The Prime Minister&#39; s scenes seem to have scripted by a 10-year-old. It&#39; s hard to depict politics or diplomacy more childishly than most mainstream films do, but this film manages. Grant is shown meeting with his Cabinet, with dialogue along the lines of: <br/><br/>&quot; Mr. Prime Minister, you really need to get tough with those Americans. &quot; <br/><br/>&quot; No, I don&#39; t think I will. Like it or not, America is the most powerful country in the world, so I think we&#39; ll just have to be nice to them. &quot; <br/><br/>Yes, it&#39; s about that sophisticated. <br/><br/>But soon the evil Americans show up, led by Billy Bob Thornton, looking hickish and sinister, another example of the film&#39; s relentless caricaturing. There is soon a negotiating scene that goes something like: <br/><br/>(Americans, haughtily): &quot; We will be continuing the policies of the previous Administration. &quot; <br/><br/>(Brits): &quot; But they are bad policies!&quot; <br/><br/>But the Americans won&#39; t bend, so &quot; bad&quot; policies it will be. (Ah, the simple logic of film. Let&#39; s have good policies instead of bad ones -- Brilliant!)<br/><br/>Later, when in private discussions with President Billy Bob, Grant steps out and returns to find the Prez nuzzling his housekeeper. So, the Americans are not only unreasonable negotiators but lechers, too! At the next press conference, Hugh&#39; s backbone stiffens, he emphatically declares that the Brits aren&#39; t going to be pushed around anymore. <br/><br/>Cut to shots of applauding, grateful Brits, wiping tears from their eyes. No kidding. <br/><br/>The writing is adolescent from start to finish. Supposedly about romance, it was about anything but: It was about how many times the writer/director could haul out the same tiresome, insulting, manipulative stereotypes and syrupy music. <br/><br/>The film begins with shots of people embracing at airports. It&#39; s a clue. The writer likes the image of love, but isn&#39; t terribly interested in what goes into it. <br/><br/>We have a new plague among screenwriters: Richard Curtis. He also gave us Four Weddings and a Funeral, which was similarly, though not quite as spectacularly, awful. <br/><br/>Is it really the case that filmgoers will find such dreck droll and clever if only it is dressed up with a British accent? There seems to be no other explanation for this man continuing to be given financial backing. ",1
"At first I was suckered in by this movie - cool British actors like Emma Thompson, swank shots of London, the British love/hate attitude towards America. <br/><br/>But slowly, steadily, it began to dawn on me - this movie is incredibly bad and misogynistic to boot. By the end of the movie I was writhing with disgust at the waste of good acting talent and two hours of my life. <br/><br/>I just saw it tonight on pay-per-view. Normally I won&#39; t pay for a movie unless I have a pretty good idea what it&#39; s about and a good sense that I&#39; ll like it. I threw caution to the wind and rented this one without all that. HUGE mistake. <br/><br/>It&#39; s the perfect movie for evolutionary psychologists. The successful pairings are older powerful men and younger women, or a young guy and 4 women, or young guy and porn star. If you&#39; re older, like Laura Linney, you get no sex with a hot hot man because your brother&#39; s a violent looney, and your entire life is dedicated to nurturing him, or you&#39; re older and married with kids, like Emma Thompson and your husband is screwing his secretary and you just suck it up. Didn&#39; t you know you&#39; re a piece of crap older woman whose sex life is over? Now go make yourself useful by making a costume for your kid. <br/><br/>I mean, I knew that evolutionary psychology was big in Britian, but had no idea things were that bad. <br/><br/>And incredibly some people claim that this is a movie for middle-aged women. Maybe middle-aged women who hate themselves. <br/><br/>And of course there&#39; s the awful awful plots. And the heaping piles of bad music and two stupid horrible scenes one after the other - the little boy on the plane, and the English guy in Portugal, with the stupid &quot; inspirational&quot; music pounding you over the head. <br/><br/>Yes, love is all around, unless you&#39; re the funny fat sister. Then you get nothing and everybody hates you - and the filmmakers invite everybody to laugh at you. <br/><br/>That&#39; s what really makes anybody with taste or sensitivity or humanity hate this movie. Because it keeps smugly patting itself on the back for its sensitivity and LOVE when in fact it&#39; s a woman-hating, schmaltz-churning, vomit-producing travesty. <br/><br/>I&#39; m so glad there is a site like this where I can not only get a chance to get some of the feelings of loathing and sickness induced by this movie out of my system, but I can see that there are other sane, discerning people in this world who also get why this movie is so deeply, fundamentally, soul-destroyingly wrong. <br/><br/>And a shout-out to NYTimes critic A. O. Scott for totally nailing this movie and its many and varied evils. ",1
"This film is truly wonderful.  I went to see it at the cinema twice and have watched the DVD 4 times since it was released.  The inter-twining relationships is nothing short of genius and the all-star cast are perfect. Bill Nighy and Emma Thompson without doubt play my favourite characters as the ageing rockstar and the betrayed housewife.  Hugh Grant is superb as the Prime Minister with a fantastic speech I would love Tony Blair to have given!!<br/><br/>The opening and closing scenes at Heathrow Airport Arrivals made me cry, infact, I cried and laughed out loud at every viewing and have still not tired of it. <br/><br/>I am astonished to see the bad reviews on the IMDB website - what a bunch of grumpy people there are out there!  When there is so much hatred and violence in our modern world, who wouldn&#39; t want to see some light-hearted, uplifting humour?<br/><br/>I literally have nothing bad to say about it and would recommend it to absolutely everyone. ",10
"So. . is it just me or was anyone else greatly offended, if not outright appalled by everything this movie had to &quot; offer&quot; ? Not only was the acting simply awful with its cheesy lines and its predictable scenarios, but there were also so many different stories it made each one lose any meaning it might have had in the process. On another less general note, I was offended by the fact that Colin Firth only started to really find his Portuguese maid attractive once she stripped down to her underwear, Liam Neeson&#39; s kid, right after his own mother&#39; s funeral, claimed he wasn&#39; t distraught over her at all - it was LOVE that was tormenting him, and the comment made by the father of the Portuguese maid to his other daughter - the &quot; fat&quot; one - saying &quot; oh shutup, dunkin&#39; donut 3000&quot; . . . . is this supposed to be funny? Because if it is, i think i may have lost hope in humanity forever. What would possess anyone to nominate this movie for not one, but TWO golden globes? There is far more to be said about this pathetic attempt at redeeming love and people in general, however it might cause me to feel ill so i will discontinue. My overall vote? If i could give it less than a 1, i would. I am ashamed of anyone I know who has even remotely enjoyed watching &quot; Love, Actually. &quot; ",1
"Well now I know it&#39; s true. And I&#39; m sad about it. British people aren&#39; t smarter or funnier than Americans. Although a higher percentage of them might be able to spell the word &quot; p. . . a. . . n. . . d. . . e. . . r&quot; . <br/><br/>But who were they trying to pander to? It really ticks me off to market a film as a &quot; women&#39; s movie&quot; when every female character over 30 ends up sad, alone, or dead. <br/><br/>Where to begin: Well, the Liam Niessen story was unseemly. An eleven year old boy&#39; s mother has just died, and he&#39; s left alone with his step dad, and the boy&#39; s biggest concern is &quot; falling in love&quot; with a classmate? I know life goes on and all that, but honestly, life doesn&#39; t go on in this way, and I don&#39; t find the practice of projecting adult thoughts into eleven year old bodies humorous or poignant. <br/><br/>And the bereaved husband, who is so torn up about losing his perfect wife that he can&#39; t complete her eulogy, ends the movie by falling in love with Claudia Schiffer. Perhaps this is realistic, if your wife dies, you should expect to end up with a Claudia Schiffer supermodel or her look-alike. But I don&#39; t find it charming. I find it smarmy. <br/><br/>And Colin Firth (40 something) is going to meet and fall in love with a beautiful Portugese cleaning woman (20 something) with whom he&#39; s never had a conversation, but first, the filmmakers have to get rid of his wife, while turning Firth into a &quot; sympathetic&quot; victim. <br/><br/>How will the filmmakers get rid of his wife so he can fall in love with a much younger woman without the audience realizing he&#39; s really just a cad? They accomplish this by having Colin Firth&#39; s British wife sleep around on him for no apparent reason in a really callous way. Then she leaves him and he&#39; s so so depressed, for about a week. He wonders why all the women he marries betray him. Perhaps, I thought to myself, it&#39; s because he falls in love with women who don&#39; t speak English and marries them?<br/><br/>I confess I found the actress who plays the cleaning woman to be the most charismatic in the movie. And if the rest of the movie wasn&#39; t so godawful, I might have let this storyline pass, but then, the filmmakers have to stick in cheap shots at her oh so comically peasant-like father and her horrible fat sister. Incredibly, the fat girl&#39; s own father seems to hate her, and the filmmaker seems to expect the audience to sympathize with him while he is nasty to her. Wonderful chick flick, huh?. Clearly, Love is All Around. <br/><br/>And Keira Knightley is so beautiful and she&#39; s all of 19 or something and she&#39; s going to marry a black man who is perfect and handsome and rich and completely incidental to the storyline. In fact, the perfect black man isn&#39; t important at all, except to signify that Keira Knightley is funky and liberal and has something to her besides her looks. Because we neither know nor care about anything else about her. She&#39; s young, she&#39; s beautiful, she has an overbite, she&#39; s going to be married. She might as well be Elizabeth Taylor in Father of the Bride. <br/><br/>Laura Linney&#39; s story is actually touching. And she acts it well. She&#39; s got to care for her brother, who&#39; s mentally ill. But he lives in a HOME! Why should this prevent her from having a relationship? Probably, because she&#39; s over 30. Again, if this were the only story about a 30 something woman ending up alone, through her own fault, I&#39; d buy it. But it&#39; s the confluence of all these anti-women story lines that I just can&#39; t take. <br/><br/>Poor Emma Thomson and Alan Rickman work to save this movie. It&#39; s not unrealistic to think of an older bossman bonking the young female help. I don&#39; t mind this storyline, but. . . again. . . it&#39; s a little hard to see the witty and wise Emma ending up in a compromise of a marriage, while Liam Niesan&#39; s character ends up with Claudia Schiffer. <br/><br/>Bill Nighy does best with his role as a star performer who puts out a cheesy single, promotes it shamelessly, and has the grace to prove his loyalty to his manager, rather than going out to a fashionable party. Good thing his manager was a fat 40 something man instead of a slim 30 something female, or he&#39; d have been left alone in the cold too. <br/><br/>I am a fan of Four Weddings and a Funeral despite the fact that Andie MacDowell couldn&#39; t keep up with the British cast, but with this new effort I am officially giving up on light British &quot; romantic&quot; comedies. I prefer the boys in the American Pie series to the cads in this movie, and the caddish screenwriters and producers who dared to market this film as a feel good fantasy for women. ",1
"I cannot believe that anyone who likes movies enough to post or even vote on IMDb would actually like Love Actually. After peeling my mangled body from the floor of my apartment I crawled to the phone and called every movie buff I know and warned them about this foul-smelling debacle. Expecting at least good acting in a movie I knew would be a sappy British comedy, after the sixty-minute mark I begged my girlfriend to let me turn it off. I didn&#39; t even notice the misogyny until after the smoke had cleared from my head after watching two hours of bad lines, worse plot, and disastrous humor. I felt like I had been drug all over London watching stupid people doing stupider (sic) things, and drugged on a never-ending storyline that, at rare intervals, might have required a teaspoon of creativity. The portrayal of women was also completely inappropriate. It was a class struggle throughout: authoritative and powerful men and the lowly enamored women acting like they&#39; re at a Beatles concert. If you haven&#39; t seen a poorly made movie in a while, see this film. Even my girlfriend agreed that it was not at all good, and was as surprised as I was that it averaged above a 2 on the voting. You want a holiday comedy? Watch Elf. I usually don&#39; t comment on IMDb, but after seeing the 7. 8 I couldn&#39; t help myself. ",1
"A stellar cast is drawn together for. . . what? For the biggest load of tripe I&#39; ve had the misfortune to sit through in a long time. <br/><br/>Hmmm. . . Romantic COMEDY? Laugh. . . I thought I&#39; d never start - and I was not wrong. Not a chuckle, not a titter was raised. Humour of the middle-class dinner party variety doesn&#39; t work for me. Lame, obvious jokes and cartoon characters abound. &quot; Common as muck&quot; Natalie swears in front of the &quot; upper-crust&quot; Prime Minister and we&#39; re supposed to find it funny? Charming? Believable??? PREPOSTEROUS?! <br/><br/>LOVE? If Richard Curtis thinks his threadbare characterizations and superficial plot lines constitute or represent love in any meaningful way then he is bonkers, actually. <br/><br/>Utter rubbish. Disney for grown-ups. ",1
"I&#39; m 84 years old and have seen an awful lot of movies. &quot; Best&quot; like &quot; Beauty&quot; is in the eye of the beholder. If by law, I was only allowed to own one DVD. . . it would be &quot; Love Actually&quot; . I fell in love with every member of the cast-man, woman and child and I find it the most entertaining movie I have ever seen. Each story is perfect and the casting, from the smallest part to the major roles was perfect. I bought the DVD based on the cast. Some of my favorite people were in it. I had never heard of the picture before, but with names like Emma Thompson, Colin Firth, etc. I decided to take a chance. I have the DVD, the CD and the Book. Thanks and congratulations Mr. Curtis! Oh yeah. . . Cut down on those bacon sandwiches. : }",10
"It&#39; s films like this that makes you despise what cinema has become - a manipulative medium that contrives a formula to tap into your base emotions with a painting-by-numbers banality.  Richard Curtis uses every clichéd, over-used, underdefined character from his big book of cardboard caricatures, then gets all his tired old thesp-chums to appear in it and churn out this sugar-sweet isn&#39; t-the-world-wonderful-even-when-you-think-it-isn&#39; t rubbish - and then has the audacity to stick it in the cinemas of the world and charge an entrance fee.  How long must we tolerate this self-indulgent travesty from a man who is the king of the dumbing-down rom-com. <br/><br/>Notting Hill and Love Actually should forever be consigned to video bargain bucket hell. ",1
"I really didn&#39; t know they made movies like this anymore. . . it&#39; s been a long time since I could honestly say that here is a movie worth seeing, renting, owning. They really didn&#39; t leave anything out. They covered all their bases on this one. As a Romance Novel Reader, and as a Romance/Comedy Buff, I say I AM IMPRESSED. And I thank whoever wrote the script and hope he&#39; s a happy man, as he has made me happy every time I watch this. It made me laugh, and cry, and hope, and dream. There was love actually everywhere. Not to mention the fact that I am Portuguese and so did not need to read the subtitles to understand those beautiful scenes in Marseilles. How beautifully written this was!!! I applaud. My co-workers applaud, my family and friends to whom I recommended this movie to applaud. . . ",10
"After seeing this I wanted to inflict actual bodily harm on Richard Curtis. I&#39; m not joking. I really, really did. Love Actually is the vilest, most ghastly, most putrid film I have ever seen. It is appalling. The nadir of Curtis&#39; s output, it is a toe-curling abomination. Where to start? What about the pure, undiluted cynicism of the enterprise, evident in everything from the music to the manipulative sentimentality to the use of children to the Christmas setting. It&#39; s a film with no heart, no structure, no sense, just a series of orchestrated, contrived scenes, augmented by the odd stale comic line (eg &#39; Now I can only get into dresses that belonged to Pavarotti&#39; ) and utterly stupid improbabilities. To go through those would take way, way too long. And what&#39; s with the use of bad language in the most inappropriate of situations? Do not see this vomit-inducing turkey of a movie, especially in a couple if you&#39; re a man because it may well end your relationship, which would actually be quite ironic, eh Mr Curtis?",1
"Of course this was run on TV in these Christmassy times and I was masochistic enough to give it another go. The posters in the hate it-section have summed it all up already I know, but even I repeat them I feel the urge to share with the world what got on my nerves most: The silly Colin Firth &quot; love story&quot; , Hugh Grant as PM is truly unbearable, the guy wooing his best friends wife, the VO in the beginning, I could go on forever. Question is why Rickman, Thompson and Ejiofor (screentime about two minutes) wasted their talent on this dreck. Only Nighy is fun to watch, his cynicism about his record should be applied to this sort of movie. ",1
"Conclusively, without doubt, undeniably, unmistakably, unquestionably and irrevocably THE worst movie I have ever seen in my life. <br/><br/>The only reason I was able to sit through it is that I couldn&#39; t look away from this horrific car crash that injured so many fine actors (not to mention a handful of appalling no-names). <br/><br/>On the few occasions that my nausea subsided, it was brought back with a vengeance by the unbelievably bad music selection, the piece de resistance being the primary school&#39; s blood-curdling rendition of Mariah Carey&#39; s &#39; All I Want For Christmas&#39; . <br/><br/>Every time you think the film can&#39; t get any worse, it somehow manages to, which is quite a mean feat I must say. . .

"I didn&#39; t expect this to mirror how my ex wife and I had to go through the stages of divorce so accurately. My son was only 2 when we were divorced and all of the ups and downs and petty fights and anger that we had for each other was exhausting but we went through it all just to fight for him, who we both love more than anything. We said horrible things to each other we can never take back but we didn&#39; t really mean and we both eventually found a way to make it work for him and to protect him from the ugliness. We made it through to the other side and have a good relationship now and work as a team to raise him with love and support but it was a long road out of hell to get there. This movie portrayed that in a way I would never have expected. It made me cry numerous times thinking of how hopeless and angry I was for so long and in that I feel like this movie deserves every accolade it gets. It felt genuine and painful but with hope at the end. It&#39; s real and powerful. ",10
"With many directors, producers and actors blaming Netflix and other streaming services for what could end up being the end of cinema as we know, the streaming service is releasing several films in theatres for a number of weeks to be eligible for consideration during awards season. Many theatres are boycotting this strategy, so aren&#39; t playing Netflix&#39; s films at all. The theatres in mostly bigger cities around the world that do play them , are selling tickets like hotcakes. After their short theatrical run, Netflix will make their Original Film available for their members. With Marriage Story, Netflix might even get their first Best Picture award handed over to them. <br/><br/>Noah Baumbach&#39; s Marriage Story is an incisive and compassionate look at a marriage breaking up and a family staying together. While we flash through important and daily situations, we hear Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) explain what she loves about her husband Charlie (Adam Driver). Charlie loves being a dad, and how it&#39; s almost annoying how much he loves it. He cries easily in movies. He&#39; s very competitive, undaunted and is very clear about what he wants. These are only a few things Nicole loves about him. After that, it&#39; s Charlie&#39; s turn to tell us what he loves about his wife Nicole. She&#39; s a great dancer - infectious. She&#39; s a mother who plays, really plays. She gives great presents. While we hear this couple recite what they&#39; ve written down, we get to meet them post-break-up in a marriage mediator&#39; s office. This was part of an assignment, to fully understand why they got married in the first place. Nicole doesn&#39; t want to hear what Charlie has written down, so what&#39; s been put in writing is only something we, as the audience, get to hear out loud. <br/><br/>What follows then is an emotionally raw journey into growing up, while trying to figure out how to survive on your own. Happiness is a personal feeling and can&#39; t be disguised as something as trivial as washing dishes or forgetting a grocery list on your way to the supermarket. We get to know little about Charlie&#39; s childhood, but Nicole&#39; s family and home are something that&#39; s right in the middle of everything. There&#39; s also their son Henry (Azhy Robertson), who gets pulled into this. Nicole thinks Henry is just like his father - almost joined to the hip. But when their marriage crumbles, and distance becomes an important factor in Henry&#39; s upbringing, their assumptions are solely things that have been witnessed while being together, and are now changing rapidly. <br/><br/>The change in personality, after splitting up and having to deal with divorce, becomes very clear in both Nicole and Charlie&#39; s behaviour. While Nicole seems very focused, meek and motherly, she turns into a woman who knows what she wants and isn&#39; t holding back anymore. The only thing she&#39; s holding back in front of Charlie - are tears. As if she doesn&#39; t want him to see how vulnerable and damaged she is by everything that&#39; s changing. &quot; Love doesn&#39; t make sense&quot; , and no truer words have ever been spoken. Charlie on the other hand, who&#39; s always been confident and career driven, is now crumbling down, defeated and uncertain of the future. <br/><br/>The cast is phenomenal. Adam Driver is the strongest of the bunch - a transformative, unseen, heartbreaking performance that no one will be able to shut up about during this year&#39; s awards season, and deservedly so. Everyone is feeding off his energy and bringing their triple A-game to this truly exceptional film. Scarlett Johansson has never been better, playing a broken woman who wants the best for her family but can no longer wait for her dreams to become reality. Laura Dern as Nicole&#39; s divorce attorney is Elle Woods all grown up and commands your attention. Ray Liotta in a comeback to the big screen (his last big film was in 2014&#39; s &#39; Sin City: A Dame To Kill For&#39; ), makes you wonder where he&#39; s been all this time. Merritt Wever and Julie Hagerty as Nicole&#39; s sister and mother don&#39; t get much screen time, but are here for some unexpectedly superb comic relief. <br/><br/>Baumbach also wrote the film and deserves all the accolades - a true master in writing and directing. He makes all of it seem effortless, with unprecedented results. The way he gets his cast to deliver minutes of dialogue, while his DOP, Robbie Ryan, zooms in and out, follows and swirls around them, to then play with shifting between different actor&#39; s facial expressions in silent moments, is utterly enchanting. The cherry on top is Randy Newman coming back to compose a score for a live action film (his last live action film was 2008&#39; s &#39; Leatherheads&#39; ) - masterful!<br/><br/>Marriage Story will get discussed in film school, years from now. It has everything to become an all time classic and will proudly get called one of the best films of the decade. A melancholic, heavy-hearted yet joyously bittersweet story about marriage and its unfortunate path to severance in order to find happiness. No cheek will be left dry. ",10
"This hit way too close to home, it was almost surreal how much the film mirrorred my own life. My parents recently went through a divorce and the way Nicole and Charlie&#39; s proceedings played out was almost too much to handle. It was almost too confronting, too emotionally gut punching, too real that I almost starting balling my eyes out in the theatre. <br/><br/>It&#39; s like this movie came at the right time and in the right moment. Just when I needed it most. This week for me hasn&#39; t been the best, a lot of things have been overwhelming for me. The film in a weird way, despite all the events devolving in chaos, told me that things are sometimes awful, unpredictable and emotionally draining but that&#39; s ok. The performances, direction, script all came together to deliver something that will always be special to me. <br/><br/>This film does have flaws, yes, but I don&#39; t really care, films like this only come once in a lifetime. Sometimes emotions mean more than cold hard criticism. I didn&#39; t expect this film to hit as hard as it did, godammit, just go see it already. ",10
"If you want a feel-good flick, I strongly advise you to reconsider watching &quot; Marriage Story&quot; . I am NOT saying it&#39; s a bad film, in fact, it&#39; s amazingly good. But it&#39; s also amazingly realistic. . . . and painful to watch due to the subject matter. <br/><br/>The story is an ultra-realistic story about a marriage that is dissolving. . . and it&#39; s painful because the viewer really grows to like Charlie (Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson). Like real life, neither character is totally bad and you understand both of their positions during the divorce. . . . but it also is very ugly and awful to see what happens when lawyers get involved. Instead of the amicable divorce they both originally agreed to, it soon becomes ugly. . . . and the pair and their devilish lawyers begin going at each other like pitbulls on a side of beef! Again. . . this is NOT a criticism. . . it&#39; s realistic and heart-wrenching to watch. I found myself crying during some of the ugliest scenes. . . . and I am sure I wasn&#39; t alone in the theater!<br/><br/>Overall, you see Johansson and Driver put on some amazing performances. . . . so amazing that I&#39; d be shocked if they aren&#39; t at least Oscar-nominated for this film. Well done in every way. . . and one of the better movies of 2019. ",9
"Firstly you need to see this very realistic and just. . . incredible performance. To just watch the scenes without any context would be worth it. However. <br/><br/>The thing that I don&#39; t quite understand is how all the promotional things says that you never side with one or the other. Constantly fluctuating between the two. That was not the case in this movie at all. I found myself constantly siding with Charlie. His wife who lied, manipulated and tried to bankrupt him goes between confused to pure villainy. And when Charlie after quite a long time eventually fires back to keep his child she acts shocked and hurt. When she has dragged him through hell and back while constantly lying about wanting to do things without lawyers or that it&#39; s just a formality. But even if you, as I do pick one side. And stick with it for the entire film. It is incredible to watch and worth every second. ",10
"I bursted out laughing just to burst out into tears a scene later. And so on. It broke my heart into pieces and then healed it. Noah Baumbach shows his screenwriting genius once again, whilst every single piece of acting from leading Driver and Johansson and from all the supporting actors is absolutely impeccable. <br/><br/>2020 Oscar winner ladies and gentlemen, that&#39; s what I hope for",9
"I was glad to catch this film at the Virginia Film Festival last weekend. Baumbach&#39; s semi-autobiographical film offers a realistic glimpse into a divorce. His writing was also phenomenal, as I found every scene vital to the plot. The script was effectively heart-wrenching and was carried by two awesome leads, at their best. Although the movie was heart-wrenching, there were also other moments when Baumbach offers the audience a laugh, while drawing them back to vulnerabilities of the main characters. The cast was magnificent. Apart from the powerful performances by Driver and Johansson, the audience is able to find depth within each of the supporting characters. ",10
"Amazing acting and script, nearly didn&#39; t watch this but glad I did. I thought the actor&#39; s involved were amazing with the leads proving they are more than their Marvel and Star Wars franchises. ",10
"This movie is really engrossing and really powerful, the characters feel and act like actual human beings and you feel like you&#39; re a part of the situation they&#39; re in. Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson are great, this is a great movie",9
"The movie the attorneys didn&#39; t want to be made. <br/><br/>In which a loving but separating couple (played by Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson) blow any possibility of a harmonious separation by bringing in their legal aides. <br/><br/>It&#39; s a sad old movie in which the couple&#39; s divorce seesaws from still best friends to raging monsters. Their natural inclination seems to favour behaviour at the friendlier end of the spectrum, but by employing teams of attorneys (at great cost), whose only interests are fiscal and competitive, any of the harmony that remains between Driver and Johansson is cruelly exposed and used as a weakness. <br/><br/>In the hands of a director less skilled than Noah Baumbach (Margot at the Wedding, Frances Ha) we could easily have ended up with either a black comedy or an overwrought drama, but this finds a line between the two, by steering a complex and subtle, and lengthy, dialogue (he is the writer) that does not allow the viewer to particularly side with either protagonist - both have their faults and their virtues - but it&#39; s the actions of their attorneys that bring out the worst, not the best, in them. <br/><br/>That said my wife and I both fell for Driver&#39; s side of the story (and only found out afterwards that the movie is based on BaunBach&#39; s own experience of divorcing Jennifer Jason Leigh, so maybe it&#39; s not quite as agnostic as we thought. <br/><br/>It&#39; s a slow build, with several long monologues that just finish, mostly, before they outstay their welcomes. <br/><br/>But there are also moments of humour. The visit of a social worker is laugh out loud funny and the rehearsal scene where Johansson prepares her terrified sister to hand over the divorce papers is likewise an absolute comic joy. <br/><br/>But overall it&#39; s both deeply personal and very affecting at times, more than once I was reaching for the Kleenex, and part of that is down to the casting and the highly personal cinematography that shows off the two leads at their most naked (emotionally) and vulnerable with long, lingering close ups on each of them. That&#39; s one reason that the big screen is always better than the TV for feature films. Like The Irishman, though, this is a Netflix original and will not be on the big screen for long. <br/><br/>Driver is at the top of his game and that means there are three serious Oscar best actor contenders this year - himself, De Niro and Phoenix. All three would win in any average year. Driver&#39; s one take performance of Stephen Sondheim&#39; s &quot; Being Alive&quot; at a piano bar is a real highlight and is about a man&#39; ; s lack of commitment. It&#39; s an excellent counterpoint to Randy Newman&#39; s typically accomplished, and in parts quite jaunty, score. <br/><br/>Johannson puts in a career-best shift. Not only is his beauty put to one side . No make up and often unflattering close ups, but she acts her socks off. <br/><br/>Also of great note is laura Dern&#39; s performance as her lawyer and a cameo role for a sprightly, 83 year old, Alan Alda. <br/><br/>It&#39; s a slow burn but it comes highly recommended from me (and my wife). Just go see it in the cinema. ",9
"When I first saw the trailer for this film it brought tears to my eyes. It seemed to me like it was going to be a roller coaster of emotions, and I really expected it to be one of the best films of the year. Don&#39; t get me wrong, it is by no means a bad movie. The acting is without a doubt some of the best that I have seen, and I believe that both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson deserve Oscar nominations for how well they did in the film. Unfortunately, I personally was not all that affected by their emotional performances, and had a lot of trouble connecting with their characters. I think older audiences, as well as anyone who has been through a divorce will connect with the film a lot more than I did. That was really my big problem with the film, apart from their child being extremely annoying at times. Other than that, the film is very well made, I did not get bored at any point, although I think it could have been 10 minutes shorter. If it were not for the fact that I felt no attachment to the characters, I would likely give this film a much higher review, likely an 8 or a 9, but I just really wasn&#39; t feeling it. Still, definitely a great film in every other regard, and I am likely in the minority about how I felt about the characters, so I would recommend giving it a watch so you can form your own opinion on it. ",6
Emotionally wrenching story formed from a simple premise Anyone who has gone through upheaval like this will recognize the feelings. Performances are so good watching it almost seems voyeuristic - like you&#39; re watching an actual occurrence. Driver is beyond amazing and cements his place as the top actor working today. ,9
"It&#39; s based on the life of a couple who are trying to get a divorce and distance themselves from each other, they hate one another for all the mistakes they&#39; ve made in their relationship, but they still respect each other and deep down still have some love for each other.
This is one of the best performances by Scarlett and Adam Driver was amazing too.
I guess Scarlett would&#39; ve highly related to the script because she had several divorces in the past, so she knows how it feels during that phase, the heartbreak, the excruciating mental trauma you go through and that can be seen in her performance. She&#39; s so natural in the emotional and verbal fight scenes.
P. S: I watched it at the Mumbai Film Festival (India) and I am planning to watch it again once it premieres on Netflix. ",10
"Noah Baumbach has always had a knack for portraying the mundanity of life with such great detail and grace, and Marriage Story is yet another melodrama that shows how skillful he is. <br/><br/>Marriage Story is a delicate dance of paradoxical emotions, weaving together themes of love, loneliness, heartbreak, and regret in such a manner that perfectly reflects the imperfect nature of human relationships. <br/><br/>Adam Driver kills as Charlie, but Scarlett Johansson destroys as Nicole. Their performances are as intertwined as they are fragmented, and they bounce off each other with effortless chemistry. <br/><br/>Marriage Story is a powerhouse of craft on all fronts. It is completely arresting and intimate. Baumbach reminds us how delicate love is, and that - amidst all the chaos that comes with it - there can always be beauty even in despondency and heartbreak. ",9
"I came in to this movie hoping for something resembling a story of two adults doing what&#39; s best for their child even though they were going through a divorce. What I got was one adult, Charlie (Adam Driver) being dragged through a river of crap by his selfish, child of a wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson). <br/><br/>Although the writers make an effort to portray Nicole as a victim by virtue of her moving to NYC to be with Charlie, the film backtracks on that narrative by Nicole&#39; s own admission that she was miserable in L. A. because of her then boyfriend. Nicole needed a change of scenery. Enter Charlie. She met him, moved to NYC, married him, worked with him to create a successful business, and then pulled the rug out from under him once his fame began to surpass her own. <br/><br/>In an effort to justify her behavior, Nicole alludes to an &quot; affair&quot; Charlie had, but we later learn that it only occurred after he and Nicole were separated but under the same roof. As Charlie put it, he was sleeping on the couch at that point and living with a woman who loathed him for his success and her belief that she gave up too much when she (voluntarily) left L. A. <br/><br/>Every act taken by Nicole in this film screams of weakness and insecurity. Nicole can be pushed and pulled in whatever direction anyone wants her to take. She and Charlie agree that they don&#39; t want a nasty divorce. So, what does she do? She hires the nastiest divorce lawyer in L. A. at the suggestion of a woman she has known for five minutes. She moves their son to L. A. under false pretenses and files for divorce in L. A. Why? Because her attorney told her to. The goal? To make sure Charlie has to hire an L. A. lawyer at great expense. You see, she knows he can&#39; t afford to fight for custody in L. A. But is that enough? Nope. Nicole then goes all over L. A. meeting with other divorce attorneys. Why does she do this (with her kid in tow mind you) when she already has an attorney? To create a conflict of interest in case Charlie wanted to retain a competent attorney of his own. Attorneys can&#39; t work with Charlie once she has poisoned the well you see. She does all this to make sure Charlie can&#39; t see his child. Meanwhile, she acknowledges how great of a dad he is. &quot; He does the things for their son that should bother him, and enjoys doing it. To the point that she hates him for it&quot; . <br/><br/>This was all done before Charlie even knows what&#39; s coming. In the meantime, Nicole continues to shower Charlie with praise and assure him she wants what&#39; s best for both of them. But, you see, Nicole is a coward. She cannot fight her own fights, and despite paying tens of thousands of dollars for her attorney (but first making sure that Charlie has to pay 30% of it), she forces her sister to serve Charlie with divorce papers. Why would she make her sister do this when it would only cost a couple hundred bucks to have it done by an actual process server? Well, because this hurts more. Charlie is close with Nicole&#39; s family. In fact, it&#39; s the only family he has and has ever had. So, naturally, Nicole wants his sister in law to serve him with the divorce papers. &quot; You have to take a side&quot; she tells her mom. &quot; You can&#39; t have a relationship with Charlie anymore&quot; under any circumstances. Why? Because, it&#39; s about the hurt. Nicole is an insecure child. Her only satisfaction in this film comes from forcing others to share in her misery. <br/><br/>As Nicole drags everyone else into her miserable existence with the hope that it will prop her up, Charlie continues propping up others around him despite his misery. He is a legitimately good person who doesn&#39; t deserve the hand he is being dealt. In a fruitless effort to fight for his child, he throws away a $625, 000 grant which was supposed to be used for his business. He becomes a victim to a society and a court system that assumes fathers are pieces of crap while mothers can do no wrong. Ironically, at one point in the film Nicole&#39; s rabid attorney states the exact opposite, that Nicole needs to be perfect but Charlie can be a buffoon. Those who live in reality know that is not the case. It takes something bordering on child endangerment before a mother loses priority when it comes to custody. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Charlie does what every man seems to do in these films. He loses. First he loses his wife because she decides on a whim that New York is no longer good enough. Then he loses his son when she moves him to L. A. under the cover of night. Finally, Charlie loses his livelihood when he can no longer afford to keep the theater open and has to choose between his life&#39; s work and his son. As the film closes we see that he has lost once more. He has lost his will to fight. He takes a menial job in Los Angeles (to Nicole&#39; s dismay mind you) directing small bit plays. His status as an up and coming Broadway director is gone. Nicole has gotten everything she wanted without even the tiniest compromise. Charlie has lost everything. He has been handed a pile of crap by his wife and is being told in no uncertain terms that he will eat it and tell her how great it tastes. If he refuses, he won&#39; t see his child. <br/><br/>While it is obvious that Johannson is not Nicole, she embodies her completely, and I personally wonder if I will enjoy her other movies in the future given how despicable a character Nicole is in this film. 5 stars out of 10 for the acting and direction, but the way Nicole&#39; s character was written makes me wonder what the goal of this film is. It certainly is not intended to make anyone feel good about the state of humanity as it currently exists. ",5
"Well deserving of the golden globe nominations, every scene is well done! Adam Driver and Scarlet Johansson are so damn good! I enjoy Marriage Story better than most movies this year. Noah Baumbach created such a masterful experience about divorce; all the arguing is acted so spot on. Also I&#39; d like to say this is Laura Durns best role I usually don&#39; t like her. ",10
"Couple agrees to divorce and settle it outside of court. He doesn&#39; t care about their apartment, stuff or money. She can have it all. He just wants to be a father for his kid. The main female character then takes away his kid under false pretenses to L. A. Hires a top notch divorce lawyer and sees 11 other top lawyers so he can&#39; t hire them. She didn&#39; t sleep with her husband for a year and make him sleep on the couch. So she clearly doesn&#39; t care about sex with him. But then she hacked his email and found out he slept with someone else during the final stage of their dead marriage. Surprise now it matters! In the end she took his kid, home, surrogate family, money and career. Destroy someone just because you can! And people cry during this movie because it is so beautiful?? It is seriously a horror movie for every father! This is the same as wife beating. Can&#39; t believe the 10 star reviews here. Emotional idiocracy. ",1
"Charlie and Nicole (Driver and Johansson) are a thirty-something, director-actor, couple with a young son. Charlie is a NY lover, Nicole is from LA and allegedly put her movie career on hold when she moved to NY to work for hubby Charlie&#39; s theatrical productions. <br/><br/>The couple is going through a rough patch, when after ten years in NY, Nicole receives an offer to star in a TV pilot and moves back to LA, with her mum and sister, bringing son Henry with her. Nicole wants a divorce ASAP, while Charlie still thinks they are getting back together and does not catch the drift until he is served papers. <br/><br/>Enter divorce lawyers, in the shape of obnoxious Nora Fanshaw (Laura Dern), working for Nicole, while Charlie hires - in succession - two lawyers with different degrees of aggressiveness (and hourly fees). <br/><br/>What we have here is two highly narcissistic people, who want to pursue their careers and find that family gets in their way. Nicole wants to do more than acting, but Charlie never allowed her to direct. With divorce comes the freedom to do so, because what the world needs is yet another director - what a shame would have been for humankind if Nicole missed her chance. <br/><br/>On the other hand, Charlie, described as self-involved, seems quite lethargic in most situations, especially when spending &quot; quality time&quot; with brat - I mean, beloved son - Henry. That kid looks a lot like the one in The Shining and he freaked me out. <br/><br/>Johansson gets lots of monologues, which seem to go on forever. Driver is an actor whose appeal always escaped to me, giving another sleepwalking performance. Dern is OTT aggressive, the stereotype lawyer you love to hate. Julie Hagerty, as Nicole&#39; s mother plays borderline crazy and she&#39; s as annoying as most of the main cast. It does not help that both Nicole (with mummy) and Charlie break into cringe-worth long songs, stretching the running time over 2 hours. I started checking my watch about half way. . . <br/><br/>Overlong and self-indulgent, this is uneven mix of &quot; Annie Hall&quot; and &quot; Kramer vs. Kramer&quot; , is still likely to find a large audience in the shape of anybody involved with a divorce (half of the US population?)",1
"I really had high hopes for this movie, since it had promising star power and an intriguing storyline. But it&#39; s apparent that most of this budget went into casting. Ten minutes deep, I was already cringing. The whole movie felt more like a stage production with overlong scenes, too much talking (spoon-feeding), and dramatic (though granted, not terribly delivered) monologues. It promises you a serious insight into a divorce between two good, well-meaning people, but its attempts at comedy fell flat and were hard to watch. Particularly with that over-acting, trying-too-hard performance by Merrit Wever, who came off as more of a cartoonish stage actress and whose character was more of a caricature. <br/><br/>There were also lines that were just bad and poorly delivered. Like one toward the start of the film where the babysitter says to them upon their return home &quot; God, you guys are so attractive. &quot; What? Nobody talks like that in that context. Little things like that make one wonder if the writer/director even bothered to get any second opinions. <br/><br/>Driver and Johansenn did most of the heavy-lifting acting-wise, which gives us small windows of hope, but even so, their on-screen chemistry seemed forged and unnatural. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie came off as more of a vanity project than anything else. Which can happen when you get a movie about movie people. The bones of a great movie are there, but a lot of fat needs to be cut. The script could be so much better with the help of a big fat red marker. ",3
"Don&#39; t get fooled by IMDB mislabelling this as a comedy and a romance. If I knew this was pure drama about the worst part of any relationship - breaking up - with long boring monologues, delivered with as much stuttering as possible in order to fake spontaneity, I wouldn&#39; t have bothered to watch it. This is not entertainment. It&#39; s just painfully boring and boringly painful. ",1
"Noah Baumbach&#39; s down-to-earth take on the pitfalls of divorce for two young parents is bolstered by emotionally weighty performances by Scarlett Johansson and Adam Driver, both of whom do some of their best work ever here. There is also a strong supporting cast, including Julie Hagerty as Johansson&#39; s mother, Laura Dern and Ray Liotta who both give witty performances as the jousting divorce attorneys on opposites sides. <br/><br/>The film&#39; s emotional labyrinth is gradually negotiated by the two leads and includes a pained, stately soundtrack that hits all the right notes. Another plus is the film&#39; s lush cinematography that gives an unhappy story a surprisingly sunny aura. Even though we are watching two people during the worst period in their lives, the world around them seems comforting and warm. <br/><br/>Usually, Baumbach&#39; s filmmaking style can be very blunt, sometimes even downright tactless. But here, his signature tone feels right at home as he portrays the frustration, heartbreak and fury that is the battle of wills of two people struggling to reach one another. It&#39; s not always easy to watch but it will leave a mark. As tough as this is to digest, it&#39; s still a work of excellence. Strongly recommended. ",8
Surprised at the glowing reviews. It was ok but fairly predictable and an unsatisfying ending. Better acted by Adam Driver. Scarlett Johansson is a bit wooden in many scenes. And a word to both Adam and Scarlett: Don&#39; t sing. Just don&#39; t. ,5
"Woody Allen did all that before but with more inspiration and better music too. This piece including all actors with maybe the exception of Laura Dern is a total sentimental bore - like really bad boulevard theater from the fifties ; -) That there are so many great reviews unfortunately doesn&#39; t bode well for the state of mind we currently have in this country. Obviously written and produced to get some Oscar recognition it fails on every level. Scarlett Johansson - really, what a let down. Midlife crisis maybe? Adam Driver? No, surely not. 2hours and 16 minutes because it&#39; s a &#39; drama&#39; - lost time. All in all forgettable. Did I mention the constant syrupy music poured over every scene? Randy Newman - what was he thinking. After everything said though - it&#39; s never the fault of the actors and whatever hired hands, the disaster lies in the hands of the writer/director. ",1
"As someone who went through this it resonated so much. I actually reconciled with partner but it was still awful. This movie was excellent its amazing nothing like this came before.
Well done",9
"This movie is atrocious beyond words, and the first movie from which I&#39; ve ever walked out (an hour and 17 minutes into it). The session was full of giggling middle-aged women, wetting themselves with anticipation - I cannot believe this book and movie has appeal. Are women really so bored, so desperate, that this is what gets them off?? The acting was appalling - I guess that&#39; s the end of Ms Johnson &amp; Mr Dornan&#39; s careers. And I wouldn&#39; t be surprised if the actors who refused the role of Christian Grey are secretly relieved they had the sense to reject it! The script was laughable. No chemistry between the two leads. As for the &#39; eroticism&#39; . . . . . it was completely lacking. Stilted, awkward, poor cinematography, cheesy scripting. Just terrible. <br/><br/>Do not waste your time or money with this. ",1
"I don&#39; t want to spoil a lot, so ill just give ratings with a brief description on certain elements of this so-called &quot; film&quot; . <br/><br/>Acting; 3/10. The acting was misplaced, awkward. . not to look at. At least convince us you&#39; re an intense guy, Mr. Grey. <br/><br/>Plot: 1/10. that wasn&#39; t a plot for a normal movie, it was a plot for soft-core porn. . which had as terrible acting in it as real porn. <br/><br/>Camera work/scenery/etc. 7/10 for what it is. . great camera work i guess and good scenery<br/><br/>Romance; 2/10. I&#39; ve seen the notebook. . . that&#39; s romance. This is a poor attempt to romance. It tries to tell you they&#39; re madly in love, but it&#39; s just a weird sexual relationship. <br/><br/>Drama: 1/10. there is no thrill. . no intense things going on. There is no drama in this soft-core-erotic-drama. <br/><br/>&quot; The deeds&quot; 10/10. . they did it. so. . can&#39; t give it any lower points than this. <br/><br/>Overall, it&#39; s was horrible acted, plot-less, non-romantic nor drama movie about a girl being horny and the guy doing an attempt of BDSM, which comes down to. . soft-core. . almost nothing different than normal sex with bondage. . boring sh*t. <br/><br/>on that note, go watch the kings man; secret service. that&#39; s one of the best action movies i&#39; ve seen in a while!",1
"&quot; Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; is based on a badly written book, so why someone thought they could make a decent film out of it is beyond me. Actually I don&#39; t think anyone believed they could make a good film, the producers just wanted the money that would come in from all people who for reasons known only to themselves read the book. <br/><br/>I had a free ticket and I had to go in order to do a story on it. Bottom line, I&#39; m not doing a story on it. <br/><br/>Okay, here&#39; s the problem, and this is what breaks my heart. We no longer know what good or great is. I am no follower of Ayn Rand, but in The Fountainhead, she predicted the rise of mediocrity, mediocrity being considered great and the norm we shoot for. It only stands to reason that at this point, some things can&#39; t even rise to that sad level. This isn&#39; t mediocre, it&#39; s pathetic. I can&#39; t believe there are people complimenting the actors. But then I can, because they have come to accept mediocrity. Something I fight against with all my heart. <br/><br/>There is one other problem. The book sucked; in order to like it, one had to use his or her imagination. The success of this book lay in the fantasy aspect. Sometimes imagination is more powerful than just about anything and can give you an erotic experience. This film doesn&#39; t fulfill the most inane imagination, let alone someone who really has a wild and creative one. The only fantasy it can give you is how fast you can get out of the theater. <br/><br/>There were people around me laughing. The ones who weren&#39; t left, and from what I found out in the lobby, actually demanded and got their money back. When was the last time you saw people leaving a movie in the middle? I&#39; m not sure I&#39; ve ever seen it, and I&#39; ll guess I&#39; ve been going to movies longer than a lot of you. <br/><br/>I lament the loss of artistic soul, of creativity, of going for the best. I miss the days when Billy Wilder was a writer and a filmmaker. What are we left with but a horrible book written on a first grade level and the resulting bad movie. ",1
"The only reason this movie gets two stars out of me is that, thanks to this mediocre effort, I&#39; ll be able to remind my girlfriend of what I put up with for her the next time I get to choose on movie night and I suggest a cheesy 80s comedy like &quot; Weird Science&quot; or &quot; The Naked Gun&quot; . I don&#39; t really need to go into all of the details here because there are more than enough detailed descriptions of this thing to spare me the effort of doing so and to spare you reading the same thing over more times than necessary. Instead, I&#39; ll just go ahead and throw my lot in with the &quot; haters&quot; , as the fans seem to be labelling us here. <br/><br/>What I will add because I haven&#39; t read it yet so far, and what I think should be an important point for perspective, is that every last &quot; 10 out of 10&quot; reviewer I clicked on was a newly created account with only this film having been reviewed. I&#39; ve been around here long enough to know that&#39; s always suspicious. I won&#39; t blatantly accuse them of being involved in the film&#39; s production or of being friends of those who were, but these new members sure are mighty keen on this rather sub-par film. You&#39; ve been warned. ",2
"Okay. So I have not read the book, (being a male), and I went with one of my female friends who HAD read the book, (and she said she had enjoyed it) -- although having said that, she had read it a number of years ago. <br/><br/>We paid our money and we took our seats. The film began; and I have to say that the wooden acting, the cruddy screenplay, the corny dialogue, the ridiculous script, the highly improbable storyline, were all just TOO much for us! (And not just us it seems! As we could hear titters from the audience at large as well coming from dialogue within the story that were supposed to be serious scenes -- so not just us I hasten to add). . . <br/><br/>We gave it half an hour and then I leaned over to my friend and said &quot; Do you think there&#39; s any chance they will give us our money back?? What do you think to it?&quot; -- and thank God she replied, &quot; Oh thank Heavens you said that; I can&#39; t stand it another minute! Lets just get outta here!!!!!!! It&#39; s just terrible&quot; . <br/><br/>We got our money back. We complained it was nothing like the book and that we demanded a refund as had only seen half an hour of the movie, and hey presto they refunded my credit card! No questions asked! <br/><br/>I give this rubbish 1 star; and that was for the pretty outdoor scenery! <br/><br/>Don&#39; t waste your time with it -- it is Hollywood at it&#39; s worst. ",1
"You simply can&#39; t make a silk purse out of a sow&#39; s ear. The book was unquestionably the worst piece of writing I&#39; d ever encountered, so what the hell were they thinking in making this rubbish? Apart from the tedium of the plod (read plot), the script is cobbled together with hollow dialogue, countless use of retch-inducing signifiers and cliché, a complete lack of chemistry between the characters and predictable scenarios and outcomes at every turn. I got the feeling throughout the film that both these actors were desperate to get off the set, go home (but certainly to separate houses), drown their shared humiliation with a stiff drink or ten, and set fire to their contracts. Woeful book. Woeful film. Don&#39; t waste your money on this drivel. There are Fifty Reasons to STAY AWAY. ",1
"I was in the mood for a great film about a young girl who meets a successful and seductive businessman with sexy results. This was not the case. This film was purely awful. No one can blame me for not being in the right frame of mind for the cinema, as some reviewers are. They see a film and end up having a bad night and they put the entire blame on the film, this is not the case for me. I was in a positive frame of mind, and really in the mood to see what I thought would be a somewhat good if not better than mediocre film. <br/><br/>This film is about two people who have no chemistry &quot; falling&quot; for each other. &quot; Falling&quot; like off a three story balcony leaving you without the use of your legs for the rest of your life. I&#39; m just going to be blunt. This film is about GLORIFYING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE and a little girl in over her head who tolerates it. The man in the relationship, Chris, in a career-ending performance portrayed by Jamie Doormat, is a control-freak who must be in control in everything he does, including the life of his BDSM buddy, Ana. <br/><br/>Not only does he creep onto her, HE BEATS HER, non-consensually while they have intercourse, he stalks her, HE INTIMIDATES HER and he shows no love for her. If this were any other film, he would be the antagonist. If you&#39; re in the mood for a movie that shows what true love is, I suggest you see Mrs. Doubtfire, as that film is about a loving family man who shows his dedication and support to his wife, even after they are separated, and his children, by dressing up as an elderly female babysitter. <br/><br/>50 Shades of Brown gets 1/10 stars from me as I am unable to give A BIG FAT ZERO. ",1
"Sorry but I can&#39; t get over Jamie Doran. . I mean he comes from playing a serial killer in the Fall (who tied up women and murdered them) to . . Well. 20 mins of sex. The movie is boring and predictable. The fine line between abuse and pleasure is so thin it&#39; s almost non- existent. Lacks any of the raunch or controversy promised, and is instead tiresome, banal and as thinly plotted as a porn. I haven&#39; t read the book. . and I have to say I didn&#39; t finish the movie. I don&#39; t think i missed much by leaving 20 mins early, but it was just boring. If a man had written the book he would probably have been jailed. Its beyond understanding what people see in the book/movie. Unless all the women I know are telling me lies and secretly want to be tied up and abused by a perverted man. ",1
"Another sad movie with a generic plot with the Mary Sue / Gary Sue relationship. A relationship so horrid that it reaches a limit when rape is involved. This book turned movie is a mere reminder that &#39; Hollywood&#39; will create anything without investigating the rather obvious &#39; unusual behavior&#39; -- which, lets be honest here, isn&#39; t unusual until you put a married man and a girl who cannot bite her lip for the life of her in the same room. It is more than evident there is no chemistry on set, and off set. Jamie, you could have done so much better. Dakota, no, just no. Thank you, EL for your horrible outlook on BDSM and your plagiarized mistake of a &#39; book&#39; . You truly have given writers everywhere a reason to wish they&#39; d never written, and a reason as to why actors never wish to take part in anything that relates to this horrible mess of a movie. ",1
"As an active member of BDSM community, and having been a part of it for six years, I am appalled by the &#39; blockbluster romantic movie&#39; that everyone deems to be &#39; romantic&#39; . You take a Mary Sue - also known as Dakota Johnson to whom lacks the ability to a) bite her lower lip in a &#39; sexual&#39; manner&#39; , let alone say her lines as if she&#39; s been acting for several years ( lets be honest here, she cannot act ) / Gary Sue - seen as the bearded wonder that was Jamie Dornan, a married man outside of his acting career with a child - situation that holds no evidence of sexual tension. <br/><br/>The inability to further deepen the bond between Dominate and submissive was, how does one say it, horrible in effort. What appeared to be every &#39; womans&#39; dream man became a man known for raping a woman purely because of his night terrors, a man to whom devoted taking the idea of BDSM and creating abuse rather than listening and allowing for someone - mind you, who had no sexual ID or preference until meeting him - who was about as &#39; vanilla&#39; as the ice cream itself, to study and look at the idea of BDSM. To those whom have taken the books route and ventured into the dark abyss that is Wikipedia to figure out what BDSM is, needs to be caned. <br/><br/>The author, herself, takes an already published series turned movie, and makes it into her own idea. A 26 year old billionaire? Unlikely in this day and age with the way the economy is. A college student with a rather unnerving need to say &#39; oh my&#39; every other second? Really? Is THIS what writing as the point of view of a woman has come down to? It seems like, although we argue against it, and we say that we don&#39; t condone it, that the women whom have read this book, have seen this movie, will and have ignored that there is rape, non consensual sex, and heavy amounts of verbal and emotional abuse. Who really wants a man who is going to control their eating habits, sleep schedule and more? Certainly not I. <br/><br/>To be frank, everyone knows this movie is going to gross millions upon its release; why? Because everyone is all hyped up to see a movie with little to no chemistry, to find that the &#39; unusual behavior&#39; is just another way of life. We magnify all the little things in the world that we&#39; ve yet to uncover, but BDSM should never be something in the movies, should never be written; especially by women in their &#39; mid life crisis&#39; age with no idea what the sensation of a crop lashing at skin feels like. <br/><br/>If you want good BDSM, or to understand it, there are people willing to discuss it, websites you can go on - although extremely sexual in nature - to figure out what true BDSM looks like, what it sounds like. When this book was written, it was evident that EL James did not do her own &#39; research&#39; . <br/><br/>All in all, it&#39; s a movie with no plot, with no true build to it with horribly written characters and nothing more. So why spend nearly good money seeing this sad mistake when you can spend that money on getting something to eat and staying inside? Complete and total thumbs down to the movie, the book, the series, and to the author. ",1
"When the end credits began to roll, I was given a fleeting look by the people sitting next to me in the cinema. They were probably checking to see if I was still alive; such was my horror and, quite frankly, disbelief, I had not moved from the same position for at least an hour. A wide-opened mouth, bulging eyes and clenched fists on the armrests at my sides. No, I was not enamoured with the movie. No, I did not find the scenes of bondage shocking. I had simply lost the will to live. <br/><br/>One might remember a famous novel by a famous author, &#39; 1984&#39; . Until I walked out of that movie house, I didn&#39; t know what had spurned Orwell&#39; s mind in the creation of his dystopian society, but now I have a vague idea. Orwell wasn&#39; t afraid of being stalked by the government - he was terrified that future society would become the way it is today. <br/><br/>I&#39; m not referring to high-octane sexual fantasies, because we all have our own desires and it&#39; s not my place to judge. No, what Orwell envisaged, surely, is acting so terrible, movies so poorly made and producers so incompetent, that the likes of Hitchcock and Bogart are probably turning in their graves. <br/><br/>With laughter. <br/><br/>Fifty Shades of Grey is a mediocre work by a laughable author of FanFiction, meaning that without the abysmal Twilight series, the TRULY abysmal movie that I have suffered through today could not have existed. Someone get me a DeLorean and a Flux Capacitor; it&#39; s time to right a few wrongs. <br/><br/>There is only one sure-fire way to improve this catastrophe and that is, quite literally, with fire. Burn it. Burn it all to ash and spread the cinders across the resting ground of Cthulhu. Without this worthy sacrifice, surely the monster will rise up to wreak havoc upon us deserving mortals. <br/><br/>All in all, I have only one recommendation for the people who will, inevitably, be dragged (ironic term, given the movie) to the cinema/theatre to watch this complete abomination: therapy. Years and years of therapy. But avoid the groups. Once you see Mr. Grey&#39; s &#39; desires&#39; for yourself, you&#39; ll probably be afraid to stand in the same room as another human being for, oh, several hundred millennia. <br/><br/>And there&#39; s worse to come: rumours talk of a trilogy, to keep things up to speed with the &#39; books&#39; . What&#39; s that sound? Oh, it&#39; s just the splatter of the blood I&#39; m currently weeping. I&#39; m sure that&#39; s unrelated. . . <br/><br/>Right? Guys? Oh. . . ",1
"Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan had zero sex appeal, for me anyway. I hoped I was going to see something a bit more provocative than predictable. However, what unfolded on the screen was a story without enough substance. So I grabbed the first hard cover volume from my aunt&#39; s large collection of &quot; literature. &quot; She warned me not to expect much and she was right. I somehow got through 150 pages of poorly written boredom and gave up. I&#39; m glad I saw the film for free. On the positive side, I can report that the Music is by one of my favorite film composers, Danny Elfman. Plus, the soundtrack includes music from the likes of Beyonce, Ellie Golding and many others which helps but does not rescue the largely silly visual acrobatics. Maybe my opinion would be different were I a repressed housewife or middle aged spinster. But that is as stupid a remark as the movie itself, given I am a man. ",1
"One must ask, how is it possible that a movie company would bother to advertise such a disgusting movie. I consider myself fairly sophisticated, however this is not entertainment . This is not a sign of being in with the times. This is not art or a venue for good acting. This is pure filth, violence and an offense to women. This movie and I use the term loosely is worse than porn , as it advertises itself as a main stream movie. At least with porn you know what your getting. This is the worst I&#39; ve seen, because former sex torture movies, remained with the horror genre , where they belonged. Disgusted is how I felt about this movie, and ashamed at the hype given it. ",1
"Despite its unsavory sadomasochistic subject matter, this cinematic adaptation of author E. L. James&#39; erotic bestseller &quot; Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; qualifies as puritanical. I can say this because I managed to get through ten chapters of the book before I saw the Universal Pictures release. &quot; Nowhere Boy&quot; director Sam Taylor-Johnston and &quot; Saving Mr. Banks&quot; scenarist Kelly Marcel have sanitized James&#39; novel and turned it into an antiseptic, &quot; Cinderella&quot; fairy tale about an affluent Prince Charming and a book-wormy English Lit major. Not that it matters, director Sam Taylor-Johnston is a woman rather than a man. Johnston and Marcel have forged a film that features simulated sex scenes without steam and cardboard characters without souls. Mind you, &quot; Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; isn&#39; t as abysmal as the amateurish &quot; Addicted. &quot; Johnston stages several sex scenes where actress Dakota Johnson bares only her breasts, while actor Jamie Dornan displays little more than his carefully sculpted abs and buttocks. Ladies hoping for a glimpse of male genitalia are going to be sorely frustrated because &quot; Fifty Shades&quot; is R-rated rather than NC-17, like both &quot; Shame&quot; (2011) and &quot; The Lover&quot; (1992) where full frontal nudity was conspicuous. Comparatively speaking, little if anything risqué occurs until the concluding scene. You won&#39; t see anything like the candle dripping sex in the Madonna movie &quot; Body of Evidence&quot; (1993); the kitchen sink sex between Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in &quot; Fatal Attraction, &quot; or the infamous &quot; Last Tango in Paris&quot; where Marlon Brando improvised on Maria Schneider with a blob of butter. Subsequent adaptations of James&#39; two novels may pass up on the prudish approach after Universal studio executives have analyzed audience tolerance. Altogether, this soft-porn entry in the trilogy shouldn&#39; t hoist anybody&#39; s eyebrows. <br/><br/>Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnston of &quot; The Five Year Engagement&quot; ) is a shy, virginal, doe-eyed brunette who majors in English Lit at Washington State University and works at a hardware store. She shares an apartment with her best friend, blond-haired Kate Kavanagh (Eloise Mumford of &quot; In the Blood&quot; ), who serves as the campus newspaper editor. As the action unfolds, woebegone, pajama-clad Kate is wrestling with a cold. Kate persuades Anastasia to pinch hit for her on a newspaper assignment. She sends her out to interview bachelor billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan of &quot; Marie Antoinette&quot; ) who rules a colossal corporate empire. Basically, Christian is the Bruce Wayne of hanky-spanky. An orphan who survived the death of his crack-addict mom, Christian has amassed a fortune, but he harbors a deep, dark secret. When she enters &#39; The House of Grey, &#39; Anastasia knows little about him. Anxious about her assignment, Anastasia makes a klutz of herself when she enters Grey&#39; s office. No sooner has she crossed the threshold than she stumbles and crumples to her hands and knees. Realizing she hasn&#39; t made the best impression, Anastasia recovers her confidence and begins the interview. Initially, Christian adopts an icy attitude toward her, but he thaws out once they start talking. Christian finds the way Anastasia chews her lip so irresistible that he cancels his next appointment. Some of Kate&#39; s questions shock Anastasia, particularly when she quizzes the tycoon about his sexual orientation. A life-long bachelor who has never been photographed in public with a woman, Christian explains that he has little use for conventional romances with hearts and flowers. A relieved Anastasia leaves Christian behind in his phallic monolith of a building and cruises home. As it turns out, Anastasia is just as captivated with Christian as the latter is with her. Later, they go on a date, and eventually he deflowers her. He wants Anastasia to join him in a sexual liaison as a &#39; submissive&#39; to his &#39; dominant. &#39; Christian and she negotiate terms of a contract. For example, the open-minded Anastasia has no problems with being tied up and titillated with a peacock feather, but she draws the line at vaginal fisting and genital clamps. Meantime, Christian does everything he can to corrupt Anastasia, buying her a Mac notebook and replacing her classic Volkswagen Beetle with a shiny red Audi. Ultimately, Christian convinces our heroine to let him show her how bondage can be enjoyable. Nevertheless, Anastasia isn&#39; t as gullible as she seems. At fade-out, she gains the upper hand in their bizarre relationship. <br/><br/>The casting in &quot; Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; creates half of the problem. Dakota Johnson makes an ideal Anastasia. She gives a believable performance as a naïve college student who has just graduated and treasures the kind classic 19th century British fiction that Thomas Hardy wrote. The Austin, Texas, born actress seems wholly comfortable with her casual nudity, and it is interesting to note that &quot; Miami Vice&#39; s&quot; Don Johnson is her dad and Melanie Griffith of &quot; Something Wild&quot; is her mom. She isn&#39; t as goofy as her literary counterpart. Sadly, lean, handsome Jamie Dornan doesn&#39; t cut the mustard. He doesn&#39; t behave like a ruthless cutthroat who owns a billion dollar corporation, and his performance is considerably less spontaneous. Although he wears his apparel well and delivers his dialogue with crisp precision, Dornan looks more like a callow amateur. In all fairness to Dornan, he impersonates a character that doesn&#39; t seem remotely believable, and his lack of personality underlines his lightweight performance. The other big problem is the film seems as impersonal as a bargain basement torture rack. Basically, Johnston and Marcel have designed it as a bondage primer that cautiously advances from one elaborate interlude to another without drumming up any melodrama. Primarily, the filmmakers rely more on winks rather than winces as our heroine navigates the dire straits of Christian&#39; s sexual calisthenics. Keep in mind, Anastasia doesn&#39; t say no until she knows better. Gradually, Christian peels back the layers of his paranoia, revealing himself as an onion that initiates our heroine&#39; s tears and fears. When director Sam Johnston shifts the focus from the game of sexual chess between Anastasia and Christian, the film sacrifices suspense. Undeniably, &quot; Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; will keep your eyes wide open, but it dwells more on tease instead of sleaze. ",5
"I&#39; ve never read the book and the marketing around the movie was so good that I had to see it. But the movie is so bad, it is not worth it. The actors are really terrible and the dialogues couldn&#39; t even exist in real life. You&#39; ll be siting for two hours to watch nothing happening in the movie besides 2 minutes of sex scenes. I can say that I laughed the whole time because it was ridiculous. The only good thing about the movie is the soundtrack which really matches the whole thing on the screen. <br/><br/>50 Shades of Grey is one of the worst movies I&#39; ve seen and if your girlfriend asks you to take her to watch it, she doesn&#39; t love you.

"This movie, and indeed the book, is NOT about BDSM. I&#39; m 25 and have been involved with BDSM since I was 16, and this movie is about nothing but abuse, non-consent, and even has a scene that is nothing but rape. <br/><br/>Grey don&#39; t listen to his &#39; sub&#39; , ignores her feeling of safety, there is NO AFTERCARE whatsoever in the entire story, not even once in the book, which would make a REAL submissive have a mental breakdown after being treated the way this girl was. <br/><br/>Ladies, you&#39; ve got mental issues if you think this movie is about BDSM. This guy is the exact thing you want to avoid if you don&#39; t want to end up in an abusive relationship. A real dominant, a real top, would never behave in the manners of this so called &#39; man&#39; , and a real sub would never accept this kind of treatment. This is abuse. This is non-consent. This is manipulative and even have a rape scene. Google BDSM for ten minutes and you&#39; ll see that I&#39; m right. <br/><br/>That is all people - this movie is a pile of trash, the book is even worse trash. ",1
"Remember I said there was a special place in hell where they torture Hitler with Twilight and Nicolas Sparks movies? Yo dawg, we based a movie on a book based on a Twilight fan fiction so you can remember the horror of Twilight while memorizing the new horror of 50 shades of gray. <br/><br/>While advertised as a BDSM erotic movie/book, 50 Shades is rather a rape fantasy. I am thankful the tampon sex scene was not included; that would be an extra nail in the movie&#39; s coffin. <br/><br/>But I guess the bad writing is not so visible in the movie form; and the average sexually dissatisfied overweight housewife might still enjoy it.

"Before the review, I think I should address one important thing: I have never read the book. That being said, you will not read any comparisons or critiques of what was left out or what was done wrong in the adaptation. I went into this movie aware of the subject matter and judged it just like any other movie. Consider this a fair review of &quot; Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; . <br/><br/>Honestly, I liked this movie. I know what you&#39; re thinking: &quot; This guy just likes seeing people have kinky sex on the big screen. &quot; No, I don&#39; t. In fact, I think mainstream erotic films offer us more than just artsy porn; they can be a fascinating look into the human subconscious like &quot; Eyes Wide Shut&quot; and they can be pure garbage like &quot; Caligula&quot; . I have come to learn that art is not safe whether it&#39; s in the horror genre, comedy or especially in the erotic subgenre. Strangely, I found &quot; Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; to be provocative of questions about love, compromise, and passion even if it borders on what most people would consider bad taste. <br/><br/>First off, what is the movie about? Basically it follows the relationship between an inhibited English student named Anastasia Steele (played by Dakota Johnson) and a mysterious, young billionaire named Christian Grey (played by Jamie Dornan). They meet for an interview and begin building an infatuation for one another but Grey keeps insisting he does not want a romance with Ana. Instead he offers her the chance to partake in a BDSM relationship in which he is the dominant and she is the submissive. When I look back, the roles match well with their personalities. <br/><br/>There is no real story I could find in this film; rather it&#39; s more about the characters. A lot of great movies focus on their characters more than plot; in this movie, it works out okay. Many of the supporting characters are snubbed for the two main players as if to say they are just there for the sake of some filler. Maybe if others found out about Grey&#39; s lifestyle and he was caught in media frenzy, the film would have a substantial plot. <br/><br/>I found Dakota Johnson to be incredibly dull in the first act but gradually she becomes more dynamic and confident as the film progressed. It feels intentional seeing how Ana starts off as a quiet, uninteresting woman only to morph into a more liberal persona. Dakota&#39; s character has a lot of those &quot; whomp-whomp-whomp-whooooomp&quot; comedic moments in the beginning which felt so forced and unnecessary to the tone. Jamie Dornan was decent as Christian Grey. Like his character, he feels in control. <br/><br/>The sex scenes are a lot tamer than I had anticipated going into this flick. Like the rest of the movie, they are shot surprisingly crisp and, might I add, nicely-paced. <br/><br/>It sounds like a simple movie but it wasn&#39; t until I asked myself one simple question that it all became interesting: Does Grey love Ana? A lot of Grey&#39; s actions I see points to yes unless it is part of a ploy to secure a potential submissive. He claims to require a written contract before ever touching Ana but blows off this condition to passionately kiss her. And once they get to the contract, they discuss their intimate limitations in an amusing, business-like setting. Ana objects to certain practices which Grey seems to willingly extract from their relationship kind of like a compromise in any other relationship. <br/><br/>One of my favorite parts is when Ana confesses her virginity to Grey after revealing his secret life. Even though he maintains he doesn&#39; t have normal sexual relations in the bedroom, Grey breaks this code to be with Ana. One might argue it is a selfish act to gain her trust so she may serve as his victim; I see it as Grey finding an opportunity to be with someone he could briefly connect with, someone untouched, someone he sees as good. In fact, at one point, he voices his concern of Ana changing his outlook on life and sounds scared of this prospect. Grey feels constrained by his past which shaped his present only to feel the need to constrain others to his level, literally. <br/><br/>Who knows? Maybe I&#39; m overthinking too much. Some people might be turned off, some might get turned on, some might think little about it, and some might find something special in &quot; Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; . I only know what I saw and felt. <br/><br/>My Rating: 7/10",7
"I have to say right from the start that I read the entire first book and that I thought it was absolutely horrible - badly written erotica at best with a lame plot and a horribly pathetic female lead and a very unlikeable hero (who was no hero to me). <br/><br/>That out of the way, I saw Jamie Dornan was cast and heard they changed a lot of the story for the movie script and thought maybe it would be OK, but it wasn&#39; t. <br/><br/>I counted 10 people who left at some part during the movie and never came back, which is rare these days as people tend to stay to get their money&#39; s worth out of the price of the ticket. <br/><br/>The settings are nice at times and so is the music, but the acting (Jamie what were you thinking????) was so wooden. It was almost like a Saturday Night Live skit, except they weren&#39; t playing for laughs in this movie they were serious, but it was cringeworthy at best. <br/><br/>Christian Grey is no hero, and Dakota Johnson was so understated it was like she wasn&#39; t even there at all. <br/><br/>Not a good movie - definitely not a date movie (I was so irritated by it by the time I left, no one was getting lucky!). <br/><br/>The good parts of the movie - really the music is the best part and the end, because it was finally over - could have been a good 20 minutes shorter! The bad parts - the script was like a really bad 1960&#39; s Mills &amp; Boon romance, and it was so slow you could honestly fall asleep if the acting weren&#39; t so painfully wooden. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a good mainstream movie to watch to get turned on, find one on Netflix, Google movies that are sexy, you&#39; ll find something much more titillating. <br/><br/>I am so glad some of the actors who were originally considered decided to say no, this movie could be a career killer! I hope it isn&#39; t the number 1 movie this week purely because it would be a shame if this drivel is what Americans actually want to watch and think is sexy. Men of course will enjoy the naked parts, of course they will, Dakota has a nice body, but as a woman, I don&#39; t ever want to be as wussy as Anastasia and I sure don&#39; t want women in general thinking it&#39; s OK to be abused by a guy in the name of sex. <br/><br/>Being tied up is great in a committed relationship, it&#39; s fun, it&#39; s NOT abusive - BUT in this movie, it&#39; s creepy, borderline degrading and just uncomfortable. <br/><br/>The funniest part for me (apart from the script!) was how uncomfortable the men who had clearly come in with their wives thinking they were going to get lucky later, and clearly wanted to leave and couldn&#39; t. Hilarious! I gave it a 1 out of 10 because you can&#39; t go any lower and the music really was quite good, but everything else, give this one a miss and wait for the UV code to come out - at least you won&#39; t waste as much money as 2 movie tickets, drinks, popcorn etc, and there&#39; s an OFF button on the ROKU, so you can switch this crapola off and just go have sex with your partner instead.

"50 Shades of Grey. The title suggests a nuanced film where nothing is black or white and motivations are murky and changeable. <br/><br/>Nothing could be further from the truth, I&#39; m afraid. Jimmy Dorman, who plays the titular Mr Grey, has all the nuance and subtlety of a sledgehammer. Further, his supposed sex appeal is non-existent. He&#39; s about as appealing as Pennywise the clown, from Stephen King&#39; s It, but about twice as creepy! Anastasia Steele, by contrast, gives the impression that she is of sub-par intelligence and is exactly as interesting as listening to your Grandpa&#39; s old war stories. . . for the hundredth time. <br/><br/>There is an utter lack of anything like chemistry between the pair and their entire &quot; relationship&quot; is based around him abusing her and her supposedly enjoying it. Now, I don&#39; t have a problem with BDSM whatsoever, but the thing I do know about it is that it is entirely consensual between both parties. If it isn&#39; t, then it isn&#39; t BDSM, it&#39; s plain and simple abuse. <br/><br/>Of course, there are those that would argue that, in the context of the movie, the &quot; consent&quot; was clear and obvious because the woman was content to let it happen. But that is treading on mighty thin ice, friends, and sounds more like justification, than any real argument as to consent. <br/><br/>In short, this movie offended me and made me laugh all at the same time, which is rare for a movie to do. I think I was more non-plussed that anyone would find it entertaining and that, along with the awful chemistry and poor acting, made me find humour in it. But I suppose I&#39; m an old fart because I find something distasteful about the subject material. I know, it is a work of fiction, and we should all be able to distinguish fantasy from reality, right? Well, yes, but I have the sneaking suspicion that, despite its &quot; R&quot; rating, an awful lot of young girls are going to see this movie and if so, then the message this movie sends to them is entirely the wrong one. <br/><br/>But, enough of my preaching. It sucks. I looked at my watch many times during the film and went for a stroll around the foyer about half way through so that I might let my eyes witness more interesting things. There was a discarded movie stub that occupied me for several minutes, before I felt obligated to return to the auditorium for the second half of this dreary non-event. <br/><br/>The fact that they released it the day before Valentine&#39; s Day just leaves me speechless with disbelief. <br/><br/>EDIT: Of course this made a ton of money at the box office, so there will be a sequel, and plenty of similar, ripoffs. Remember when we all bemoaned the &quot; new&quot; craze of Young Adult, Dystopian fantasy films? Welcome to the next big genre folks! Soft-porn at the cinema!<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Ridiculous, badly acted and lacking anything like entertainment. No chemistry between the two leads. Glorifies abuse and then tries to tell you that is what you wanted all along. Just a waste of your time. Trust me. ",1
"Fifty shades is an awful film no doubt, but it had to be made no question, and here is why. Purely from an economic standpoint Comcast, that owns Universal had no choice. How could they say to their share holders that they passed on such a cash cow, allowing Warner, Fox or Sony to rake in the profits that this movie is guaranteed to make. The board meeting probably went something like this. <br/><br/>&quot; We have an option on this book &#39; Fifty Shades of Grey- Now this one of the worst books ever to be written, but bear with me here, because this book is selling like hotcakes to desperate housewives everywhere. It&#39; s a no brainer we have to make this movie. The great thing is that we don&#39; t even need to make a good movie, it only has to be almost as good as the book, and since the book is so bad to begin with, that means that the bar is already set very low. We just can&#39; t fail. <br/><br/>It&#39; s not Lord of Rings, the fan base isn&#39; t looking for great quality, if they were they wouldn&#39; t have bought the book in the first place, and that means we don&#39; t need to spend much money developing the script. Neither do we need to waste money on any A list talent. Forget Tom Cruise, and Keira Knightly, just get a couple or relatively unknown actors, they don&#39; t even need to be that good as long as they can remember their lines. And we don&#39; t need to budget for a great director either. Let&#39; s face it we are not remaking Citizen Kane here, so keep Spielberg and Scorcese for another project. Heck, we don&#39; t even need to pay out for someone like Ridley Scott and he&#39; ll pretty much do anything these days. No an unknown mediocre director will do, but make sure that the director is a woman as it will help to deflect any negative PR from those folks that think fifty shades glorifies domestic abuse and the like. <br/><br/>Now here is the best part. Here is how we can make a ton of money out of this steaming dung pile. There are two days in the year when even the most Jockiest of alpha male guys who normally only watch action movies will happily take their significant other to see a chick flick. One is on her birthday, and the other is Valentines day. Since birthdays fall every day of the year, then February 14th has to be the release date. <br/><br/>Oh and as luck would have it, Valentines day this year falls on a Saturday, so not only will all the male schmucks who think taking their girl to see this pic will get them laid later, all the single ladies who don&#39; t want to be stuck inside on this evening will come out to see this movie in droves with their girlfriends. <br/><br/>Seriously guys, we&#39; ve been handed a gift horse. Let&#39; s green light this thing and make ourselves a huge pile of cash&quot; . ",1
"I don&#39; t know what people were expecting. I hadn&#39; t read the books before seeing the movie and I am assuming that maybe this was a good thing. I enjoyed the film. I do not agree with the lack of chemistry either. There was a weird chemistry which I believe made sense because of the unusual relationship. He is an odd character and she is intimidated and is also very innocent therefore it isn&#39; t going to be the usual sexual chemistry that you would find in a romantic film. A lot of people have said there was not enough sex or it was not raunchy enough. Firstly, if there were any more sex scenes it would have got quite boring, and instead we got to see a bit of a story line. Also there is only so much that they can show in a film, surely? What were people expecting? Also one final point in relation to the comments I have seen regarding the film giving S&amp; M a bad name; I don&#39; t agree. This is a specific story about one guy who is into specific things and goes about things a particular way. It was all consensual (and it is made clear that it must be). The whole point of the story is that Christian Grey&#39; s sexual desires are confusing for Anatasia to understand and that the relationship is quite complicated due to their mutual feelings for each other. I have also seen comments that this film is sexist and degrades women. This film does not promote that at all it merely shows a story of someone who practises in S&amp; M and in this instance the man is the dominant. She has a choice as to whether she wants to engage in this and the film does not say &quot; this is okay&quot; and &quot; woman should do this&quot; . The character was not forced to do anything. I do not get why people feel the need to accuse films of implying or portraying such things. <br/><br/>Obviously this film is not perfect and there are things that could have been better but I enjoyed this film and personally would recommend it to others. I can get quite bored in films but I was not bored at all, I have paid more to see films that are A LOT worse than this. ",10
"Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar). <br/><br/>It is said &#39; Titanic&#39; is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film. <br/><br/>Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story. Apart from that, the film was thrilling, exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word!",10
"Every once in a while the conversation will turn to &quot; favorite movies. &quot; I&#39; ll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they&#39; re too embarrassed now to admit it. <br/><br/>I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again. . . . in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won&#39; t even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let&#39; s get something straight -- you don&#39; t look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic. <br/><br/>No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film. <br/><br/>Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait &#39; til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully. <br/><br/>James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed. <br/><br/>This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, &quot; flying&quot; . &quot; Iceberg, right ahead!&quot; The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears. <br/><br/>The music, which has also been a victim of the film&#39; s success, was a key ingredient. James Horner&#39; s score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion&#39; s pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many. <br/><br/>I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I&#39; ve had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity. <br/><br/>Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed. ",10
"Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don&#39; t think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn&#39; t watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5. 99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo&#39; s real nose? OK, I know that&#39; s silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage. <br/><br/>The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old Rose boards the ship with her controlling fiancé, Cal Hockley and her desperate for money mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a first-class formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing, music and beer in third-class. After revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks, they then witness the ship&#39; s fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape together. <br/><br/>So does Titanic live up to it&#39; s hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and Leo Mania was born at the time. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but please don&#39; t let the haters bother you from watching this great movie. It has great acting, amazing effects, beautiful costumes, outstanding sets, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn&#39; t get a lot of hype just because of Leo&#39; s baby face or Kate&#39; s amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. Otherwise I don&#39; t think we&#39; d still be talking about it so many years later. Kate and Leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time. Despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot, I think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together. James Cameron, the extreme perfectionist that he is, went over time and money budgets for Titanic, but this was his baby and it paid off very well. James had captured everything about Titanic and the sinking so well. He respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn&#39; t just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage. He had every right in my opinion to scream &quot; I&#39; m king of the world!&quot; at the Oscars, because this movie blew everyone out of the water(no pun intended), you know what? I&#39; m going to admit it, I love Titanic, even past my teen years I absolutely adore this movie, it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too since I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. Remember one thing, be true to yourself, don&#39; t follow the crowd, lovers or haters, if you go with the hype you&#39; re always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it, then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever. I do recommend Titanic, it&#39; s a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day. <br/><br/>10/10",10
"Good Lord. This movie right here, it&#39; s a masterpiece. I am not exaggerating when I say this. Tonight was the first time I watched this. I watched some parts of it earlier, but I thought it would probably be boring, and that I had better things to do. Tonight I watched the whole thing with my grandmother. I was completely wrong on that. This was the best movie that I&#39; ve ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it. There were two scenes which made me cry: the part where the orchestra played &quot; Nearer, My God, to Thee&quot; and the end when all those perished on the Titanic applaud at the kiss of Rose and Jack. This movie was absolutely amazing and I would watch it over and over again. ",10
"Titanic is one of my all time favourite films. I&#39; m a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. <br/><br/>We all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being &quot; unsinkable&quot; - tease the audience, almost to the point where you&#39; re like &#39; is it really going to sink?&#39; <br/><br/>I thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: I cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. Taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like Fabrizio and Murdoch the First Officer and countless more. It was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. You remember Jack telling Rose all the places he&#39; s going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. The Irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. The violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. And the music! Wow. I cried for all of this. And especially right at the end when you see the photos of Rose&#39; s life, knowing she&#39; s fulfilled her promise and survived, living a full life, probably never having met anyone she loved as much as Jack all those years ago. <br/><br/>Visually pleasing in every way, dramatic, musically astounding, great acting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic, enduring film. A romantic-drama unlike any other. It deserves higher than 7. 7. ",10
"To all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that. . . . who wants to hear it?  IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that&#39; s your loss.  The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think.  I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book.  It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted.  I know that it is the cynical 90&#39; s and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that?  It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet.  I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done. ",10
"I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. &quot; It was so great, &quot; she said. &quot; You really felt like you were on the ship. &quot; &quot; Nonsense, &quot; I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, &quot; you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she&#39; ll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested. &quot; &quot; Well, maybe, &quot; thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. &quot; OK, &quot; I thought, &quot; I&#39; ll give it a look see. &quot; I didn&#39; t want to like it - and I didn&#39; t. I loved it! What a great movie. <br/><br/>Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost &quot; you are there&quot; type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don&#39; t just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet&#39; s being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect &quot; t&quot; I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose&#39; s mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I&#39; m no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion&#39; s performance of &quot; My Heart Goes On. &quot; <br/><br/>Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don&#39; t accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he&#39; s been there for a while. ) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. <br/><br/>A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive. <br/><br/>9/10",9
"You can watch this movie in 1997, you can watch it again in 2004 or 2009 or you can watch it in 2015 or 2020, and this movie will get you EVERY TIME. Titanic has made itself FOREVER a timeless classic! I just saw it today (2015) and I was crying my eyeballs out JUST like the first time I saw it back in 1998. This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding! <br/><br/>Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio definitely created a timeless classic that can be watched time and time again and will never get old. This movie will always continue to be a beautiful, painful &amp; tragic movie. 10/10 stars for this masterpiece!",10
"I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn&#39; t THAT bad or else people wouldn&#39; t even BOTHER to talk about it.  I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do!  I guess this film isn&#39; t for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many. <br/><br/>As for those that think that this film is &quot; overrated&quot; or &quot; over-hyped&quot; . . . well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol*  You see, it&#39; s not CRITICS/article writers that make a film &quot; HUGE&quot; or a &quot; HIT&quot; with the general movie-going public.  PEOPLE make the film a huge success.  With Titanic, everyone was in awe.  Let&#39; s face it, a film like this had never been made before.  At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched!  <br/><br/>Give this movie a break you guys!  The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time!  When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie. . . not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more!  So, I really wouldn&#39; t say that this movie was &quot; overhyped&quot; . . . at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being &quot; overhyped&quot; .  ha!  Critics didn&#39; t even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron&#39; s gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film.  However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more!  <br/><br/>Personally, I LOVE this film.  However, this film might not be for everyone. DOn&#39; t say that this film sucks just because of romance though!  THat is the most sexist thing I&#39; ve ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it!  The story was sweet.  The dialogue could have been better, but let&#39; s face it. . . the REAL star of the movie wasn&#39; t Leo or Kate. . . it was that GIGANTIC Ship!    I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job.  It&#39; s not thier best work (I&#39; ve seen much BETTER work from both of them) but it wasn&#39; t the WORST I&#39; ve seen on screen before. Give them a break!",10
"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane). Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes. <br/><br/>The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the Titanic&#39; s legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 11: 39, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2: 18 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanic&#39; s many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic. <br/><br/>Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Rose&#39; s mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanic&#39; s officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smith&#39; s last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaire&#39; s Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer&#39; s former Canadian hometown. As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-English speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss&#39; .  Not wanting to leave her husband&#39; s side Mrs. Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr. Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the Post-Victorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the women&#39; s suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to `new money&#39; such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking. <br/><br/>A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.  The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people&#39; s lives.  Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night.  In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990&#39; s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter. <br/><br/>
Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.  At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film. <br/><br/>Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic.  Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn&#39; t take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing.  If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900&#39; s and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you. ",9
"This movie re-wrote film history in every way.  No one cares what anyone thinks about this movie, because it transcends criticism.  Every flaw in the movie is easily overcome by the many amazing things the movie has going for it.  It is an extremely beautiful movie, and I doubt many of us will see anything like it again. I&#39; ve seen it more times than I care to count, and I still become transfixed every time, with a feeling which is hard to describe.  One for the ages. ",10

"Thirteen years after Titanic launched and all it takes is the first few bars of that haunting music to transport me back to my first time watching the movie in the theater. It was beyond comprehension - the entire spectacle and production. I bought the books, read the history books and found myself immersed in all things Titanic. <br/><br/>I didn&#39; t hurt that my great, great aunt was on the ship and survived. It makes it a little personal for me. In fact, I happen to own one of the only objects in existence that came off of the ship into a lifeboat and did not go into the water. <br/><br/>Love the movie - it still is #1 in my book. ",10
"For me, the best film of all time, as a work of art, his memory is perpetual in my memory and his greatness to this day excites me. ",10
"It&#39; s a crying freaking shame that this outstanding movie&#39; s rating has been dragged down by small people who hate it because it was successful. You should be ashamed of yourselves. <br/><br/>When I first saw it I thought it was the perfect movie, and it&#39; s still one of my favorites 8 years later. It&#39; s got sexual tension, action, social commentary, and the acting doesn&#39; t suck. It&#39; s even got Bill Paxton, one of my top 10 criteria for a great movie. What&#39; s so horrible about it that it deserves an aggregate 6. 9? The only reason I can think of is this perverse habit people have of hating anything that makes so much money or is otherwise successful that it makes them doubt their own worth. That&#39; s just sad, and you shouldn&#39; t take it out on an innocent blockbuster. ",10
"I don&#39; t know how to explain my feelings, but this movie give tears for my eyes. . . ",10
"Even though some of the actual events did not occur in reality as portrayed in the film, I feel as if the film portrayed the events to the best of their ability. I thought that the film did a good job of displaying the hardships and diversity between social classes. The character&#39; s interactions and emotions about the situations and conflicts they were faced with were also depicted well. Leonardo DiCaprio (one of my favorite actors) and Kate Winslet play amazing roles as Jack and Rose, and they do it justice! The connection and relationship between the two is a story in itself within the film as well as the ship&#39; s tragedy. <br/><br/>As a young girl I watched this movie many many times with my grandmother. After watching it so much I became obsessed with learning about the Titanic. To this day I still enjoy doing research about the actual ship, the people aboard, the engineers who built the ship, the accident, the aftermath, and what is still being found in the bottom of the Atlantic. Eve since I was young I have loved The Titanic. I hope you do too!!",10
It really physically hurts me when i don&#39; t see it in top 250 in IMDb&#39; s list. I am from India where the general perception of Hollywood movies are that they are more action oriented big budget entertaining films. We consider our films to be more emotional and poignant. <br/><br/>However this movie is the most heart touching story i have ever seen on screen. I could see people&#39; s faces with tears rolling down after departing from the cinema hall. I could hear my father saying &quot; Never knew that these people could make such heart warming movies&quot; . Maybe i am going a bit too far. But this is my way of paying tribute to the greatest movie ever made. ,10
"Such a beautiful love story. one of the most legendary movies ever made, and i love it so much! acting is really amazing, leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet are both so talented and they nailed their parts! the plot is super good, and i don&#39; t think this classic contains any negative things, except jack&#39; s death and the fact that this movie is very sad. . but i&#39; m still giving it a 10 because let&#39; s face it, it&#39; s a classic. duh",10
"When you have a film this big and successful, it just stands to reason that a number of people are going to try to bash it. Especially when it happens to be a romance. And sure enough, I am the only male I know who has anything positive at all to say about it. Is all of the criticism warranted? Let&#39; s see. . . <br/><br/>Jim Cameron didn&#39; t need to create this huge-scale, heavily detailed historical drama to prove to me he was a great director. This film did pretty much convince the rest of the movie-going world, though. We all know the story of this great luxury liner sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on that chilly April evening in 1912. The substantial loss of life still ranks among the great human tragedies of recent history (9/11, Pearl Harbor, etc). Cameron spared no cost of either time or money to make the ship and its furnishings look exactly as they would have on that maiden voyage. In terms of technical detail, this film is without peer. <br/><br/>
The cast is generally appealing. Leo DiCaprio is far from a world-class actor, but his enthusiastic and earnest portrayal of Jack Dawson couldn&#39; t have been done better. Kate Winslet looks right in her element as a pampered young debutant trying to brake away from her boring life consisting of endless dinners and tea parties. Kathy Bates as &quot; The Unsinkable Molly Brown&quot; is always likeable and the rest of the cast (mostly Brits) does a good job of filling out their respective roles of cast and crew. Billy Zane gives the film&#39; s best performance as Winslet&#39; s greedy, snobbish fiancee. He is one of our most underrated actors. And you have to love David Warner as his bodyguard/enforcer.   As far as the special effects go, it&#39; s hard to imagine the sinking of the ship could have been filmed any better. Each time you view it, you seem to get a different perspective of just how lucky any of those passengers were to survive not only the actual sinking, but waiting around in life boats for help to arrive. As of this writing, only three known survivors are still alive. One can only imagine how many countless hours it took to conceive of, shoot, and edit the last hour of the film. The results are terrific. <br/><br/>There are flaws in the overall mix, however. Some of the dialogue (Mostly Leo&#39; s) is down right corny. &quot; When you&#39; ve got nothing, you&#39; ve got nothing to lose!&quot; or &quot; You seem like kind of an indoor girl&quot; are two examples. Also, the notion that a guy from steerage class could go up and mingle with the first class passengers under any circumstances is not plausable. Keep in mind that a first class ticket on Titanic in today&#39; s economy would go for $80, 000! These were some RICH people, and they wouldn&#39; t have let a guy like Dawson near them. <br/><br/>Anyone who watches this film will have to endure numerous scenes of sappy romance. This film is a romance above all else. Just tough it out if it bothers you. It&#39; s not that bad. <br/><br/>This film is tragic, exciting, sensual, pretentious, corny, extravagant, and even a little cheesy. And I love EVERY DAMN MINUTE OF IT!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>5 of 5 stars. <br/><br/>So sayeth the Hound. ",10
"I loved this film for the subtleties. Lots of lingering, carefully framed shots and closeups. Lots of quiet scenes. Lots conveyed through looks and innuendo. <br/><br/>Rooney and Cate captured what it&#39; s like to be nervous yet excited while falling in love. It felt real. It felt like two people unsure of themselves, offering up just a bit of their true feelings at a time and waiting for the other person to do the same before revealing more. <br/><br/>Kyle Chandler&#39; s performance hasn&#39; t been commented on as much as the leads, but he was just as excellent. He played the part of tortured husband well without coming off as a mere villain. I sympathized with him and even understood where he was coming from. <br/><br/>I thought the film captured the time period in a very unique way. Nothing was overtly flashy or Normal Rockwell 50s, and at times it even felt gritty compared to most depictions of the era, but it was really beautiful. <br/><br/>The film stayed with me on the ride home, and I drove in silence while I reflected on it. That&#39; s how I judge a movie. If you are the type that loves character driven films, I&#39; d very much recommend it. If you don&#39; t handle slow burn movies well, it might not be for you. ",8
"Finally. FINALLY. This is the movie which completely overwhelmed my expectations and blew me away. <br/><br/>Romance is actually one of my favorite genres, but unfortunately it has let me down a lot more than once. Not the case with Carol. This has a strong possibility of being the best movie of 2015. <br/><br/>Therese is a woman working in a store who has an interest in trains and photography. But her hobbies is not enough to escape her boring and quite uneventful life. Carol has a wonderful daughter and is doing fine financially. . . but has an husband (whom she is trying to divorce) who won&#39; t leave her alone and makes her feel miserable. <br/><br/>These two people meet, and. . . they connect. <br/><br/>First off, the story itself is already incredibly captivating. It takes place during a time period where homosexuality was not only frowned upon, but there were even laws against it. So seeing the two of them facing struggles in order to keep in contact with each other is fascinating to behold. And it is because the love story is so damn beautiful. There is a lot of visual language. Eye contact and body language often speaks for itself. And it&#39; s excellently executed, as you sometimes know exactly how these two character are feeling without a single word spoken. And even the dialogue itself has subtlety to it. There are plenty of times where either Carol or Therese insinuate feelings by using seemingly casual sentences. &quot; Your perfume. . . it smells good. &quot; is really just a synonym for &quot; I want to kiss you&quot; . &quot; Oh stop it, you look perfect!&quot; can very well mean &quot; I want to spend the rest of my life with you. &quot; The lines are not obvious giveaways and I love it. The audience gets to think for themselves. <br/><br/>But what really makes this movie work is the acting. It&#39; s absolutely amazing. Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are at their best ever. They make the characters so real, so human, that you wish they actually existed. Kyle Chandler also throws in a remarkable performance as the husband. You root for the two girls. . . but you don&#39; t hate Harge either. There is one scene where he has gone so far as to get himself to the house Carol and Therese is staying at for the weekend. And when he&#39; s told he can&#39; t have her, I was really feeling bad for the guy!<br/><br/>I can&#39; t remember the last time I have been as touched by a movie. It hit my heart just in the right places, and when I walked out of the theater I felt like I had just experienced someone else&#39; s life. <br/><br/>Okay, the trailer revealed too goddamn much from the movie, so several important plot details I already knew beforehand. But even that couldn&#39; t stop the perfectly orchestrated ocean of emotions it bathed me in. Carol will stick to your brain like glue after you&#39; ve watched it. Oh and the movie too ; )",10
"Carol is a good film, with a very important subject, and the script never addresses it head on, rather with class, elegance and subtly. <br/><br/>It&#39; s a great love and life story about one woman fighting for her right to be happy and another trying to figure out how can she really be happy. Each of them is the answer to the other. <br/><br/>The script could feature more insight, but then again, the film is supposed to be subtle and let the images speak for themselves. The cinematography is outstanding and the score is downright superb. There&#39; s a feeling, a certain atmosphere that makes the film truly peculiar and one of a kind. <br/><br/>But in the end, i think that it all comes down to Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara, as they give unforgettable, brilliant performances. They are always perfect of course, but here there&#39; s something one of a kind about their performances. Its not only the characters that fall in love with each other, but also you who fall in love with them. <br/><br/>Its charming, important, powerful, resonant, and features two one of kind performances. ",8
"It&#39; s an inevitability that Carol will face categorisation as an LGBT film, but that&#39; s not the limits of how it should be considered. It&#39; s simply a heartfelt and deeply human love story where the principle couple confronts insurmountable odds. In Carol&#39; s case, these obstacles are the prejudices of the time and culture they live in. The film frames this discrimination in a tangible and legal way, as the titular Carol is accused of a morally indecent lifestyle by her ex-husband in order to win custody of their daughter. The film isn&#39; t interested in being a courtroom drama though, instead focusing on the blossoming relationship between Rooney Mara&#39; s Therese and Cate Blanchett&#39; s Carol. <br/><br/>Todd Haynes is known for his heightened style that evokes the melodrama of Douglas Sirk, for instance. His 2002 film Far From Heaven feels plucked from the cinema of the 1950s. However, Carol is a film that feels plucked from the New York streets of the 1950s as the aesthetic here is surprisingly naturalistic. It doesn&#39; t quite breach a documentary-esque style with Edward Lachman&#39; s understated and pleasantly grainy cinematography, but it all comes organically and authentically with the elegant fashion of production and costume design and the atmosphere that its cold Christmas setting provides. It&#39; s a very restrained film – as there are only two particularly intimate scenes – but the film carries an air of sexual and romantic tension throughout. <br/><br/>As Carol, Cate Blanchett challenges her polar opposite and equally excellent work with Haynes as a Bob Dylan incarnation in I&#39; m Not There here. By nature of the film&#39; s structure, the first half is in the perspective of Therese and the second focuses on the perspective of Carol. There&#39; s an interesting inaccessibility about Blanchett in the first half that draws you into Therese&#39; s infatuation. Mara, one of the most promising actresses of this decade since her small memorable part in The Social Network, uses her own reserved detachness – something she&#39; s been frequently criticised for – to her own advantage. To watch someone like Therese open up after being so repressed is thoroughly cathartic. <br/><br/>However, Blanchett whips the film from under her feet in the second half. She litters the first half of the film with nuanced hints and clues to her past desires, also communicating so much with very little. She&#39; s elusive, but Mara is a key source of intrigue at that point due to the honesty in her performance and unexpected dry wit. Once Carol is struggling to deal with her own internal conflicts, Blanchett is on fire and burns the house down with her ultimate rebuttal of the accusations against her. Kyle Chandler, her suffering husband soon to be ex-husband, shows such painful anguish in his brief outbursts. It&#39; s a measured performance that anchors the film and the stakes of the relationships. Every performance of the ensemble – from extras to bit parts – are delivering among their finest work. <br/><br/>It&#39; s an all-rounder in terms of Oscar-contention, with Haynes perhaps being a more likely bet for Best Director than the film is for Best Picture. Blanchett has won too recently but if Weinstein works his magic, Mara would be a strong contender in either leading or supporting. Phyllis Nagy will certainly duel with Aaron Sorkin in Best Adapted Screenplay, even if her work is more patient, while the production and costume design ought to destroy competition. A sure bet should be Carter Burwell for his beautiful score that sunk my chest with its few powerful notes. It&#39; s an achingly tender film that will be timeless, even if it doesn&#39; t resonate with everyone with such specificity. Carol shouldn&#39; t just be a statement for our time and a condemnation for past mistakes, it&#39; s a demonstration that love is a part of the human condition regardless of sexuality. <br/><br/>8/10",8
"Thanks to the New York Film Festival I got the chance to see this perfectly crafted film early. <br/><br/>Carol&#39; s nothing short of fantastic. It&#39; s story is one of the best romances i&#39; ve seen put on the big screen. What I love is how nobody makes it a big fuzz about the two lovers being females. It&#39; s treated with the same respect as any other romantic drama, and it&#39; s done better than most of them. <br/><br/>The film is on another level when the two leads Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are on screen together. Both undoubtedly gave two of the best performances of the year. <br/><br/>It&#39; s pace is slow, but never boring. Giving us some intense slow-building moments that leaves us smiling or shedding tears. <br/><br/>Carol&#39; s great. Watch it. ",9
"Others have already mentioned the film&#39; s beauty, elegance, attention to period detail, acting etc. All amazing. As a gay man &quot; of a certain age&quot; I felt deep gratitude for the gift given by the artists who created this film. The direction is so subtle and effective, using the all the tools of film making to communicate information, meaning, and emotion. <br/><br/>Like Brokeback Mountain, this film turns cliché on its head and transcends the particulars of the protagonists&#39; lives by illuminating more universal themes. It is a period/genre film that acts to balance well established tropes of its genre, a powerful corrective to SO MANY previous films that repeated the same old false, stereotypical, and often tragic images of gay lives. Beyond merely telling some real truth, Carol has so much to say about strength, resilience, and the possibility of finding joy in difficult circumstances. As such, it was deeply satisfying to this viewer. ",10
"I watched Carol at the New York Film Festival, days after watching Freeheld. Since both movies talk about love relationship between two women, I was afraid I was going to see the same thing. Gladly, I couldn&#39; t be more wrong. Carol is such a beautiful movie, subtler than I had expected. <br/><br/>Even though I loved the movie, I&#39; m aware that it&#39; s not for everybody. It&#39; s not fast paced, as current films tend to be. It takes its time to carefully construct the characters and to make us root for them. Credit is due to the cast, as Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara are brilliant, and to the director Todd Haynes, who conducts well the story. <br/><br/>Moreover, the film is visually stunning, with impeccable make-ups and wardrobes, not to mention the beautiful locations covered in snow while they take a road-trip. Finally, the soundtrack is equally wonderful, with songs that correctly set the tone of their relationship. <br/><br/>It probably won&#39; t be a box office hit, but I do hope everybody gets a chance to see it eventually. <br/><br/>Full review: http: //wp. me/p5Rk4c-f6",9
"**WARNING: Contains plot spoilers**<br/><br/>I don&#39; t normally write reviews but this is a case where the critics seem to be totally disconnected from what they are supposed to be reviewing. It is weird to see so little dissent in the press about this film. Carol has many good points but more bad points. <br/><br/>The good points are the amazing production design and costumes, and the interesting 16mm cinematography (which does get quite grainy at times). The technical side of things is fine, it looks very beautiful and old-fashioned. <br/><br/>The main problem is that there just isn&#39; t any emotional connection established between the two main characters, or between anyone really. The film doesn&#39; t make you care about people or their fates, and doesn&#39; t explain why they would care about each other. <br/><br/>The very first meeting between Carol and Therese highlights this. Carol tries to seduce Therese because. . . well, she just does, from the very first moment she lays eyes on her in the department store. We don&#39; t know why, Carol has never met her before so presumably it&#39; s just because Therese is young and pretty. We don&#39; t even see Carol reacting to Therese&#39; s beauty, Carol just has this predatory gaze from the very first frame, as if she was determined to find someone, anyone. How much sympathy would we feel for a middle-aged married man doing these things instead of Carol?<br/><br/>Because of the way the story unfolds, it is also very hard to shake the feeling that Carol is a rich person who is, in the end, able to get whatever she wants. <br/><br/>There ought to be sympathy for Carol being stuck in a dead marriage, but she is getting divorced and already having an affair. <br/><br/>There ought to be sympathy for Carol losing custody of her daughter Rindy, but we never really see the mother-daughter relationship enough to understand what this means to her. For example, in the first scene Carol buys her daughter a train set instead of a doll in order to impress the young shop assistant that she lusts after. We later see Carol playing with the train set by herself while thinking of her own problems, we never see the daughter using it. The daughter seems to be little more than a plot device or a prop. <br/><br/>There ought to be sympathy for gay lovers being parted by a bigoted 1950s society, but we never really see them as lovers. We see them make love, but there isn&#39; t really a scene where they display any kind of chemistry or deep affection. They come together because. . . well, they just do. To make matters worse, they split up almost as soon as they have got together, so we don&#39; t really get the time to feel anything significant has been lost. <br/><br/>The saddest part is when Carol dumps Therese so she can go to fight for her daughter&#39; s custody, but then when, thanks to her lawyer&#39; s manoeuvrings, Carol has a realistic chance of getting joint custody of her daughter, she waives her rights to it. Why? Because it means she can avoid the hassle of a nasty court case. How deep can Carol&#39; s love for Rindy or Therese really be if these are her priorities? And why tell us that the custody of Rindy means so much, more than her love for Therese, and then show her abandoning custody? Perhaps the novel explains why this makes sense, but the film certainly doesn&#39; t. <br/><br/>The two hour running time should have been long enough to get proper emotional connections built up, but instead the director squanders it on overextended scenes that should have been much shorter. It makes the whole film drag on without any character development. <br/><br/>At one point Carol&#39; s husband Hodge has a door slammed in his face, it ends on a nice shot of his partially-covered features, but it then goes on to show him walking away from the house, getting in a car and driving off. Extending the scene didn&#39; t serve any purpose, we know he&#39; s annoyed and isolated but he&#39; s been annoyed and isolated for the entire film. Another example has Carol and Therese arriving in a hotel, they enter the lobby, they enter the room, they admire the room and then. . . it cuts to them leaving the hotel. What did we learn about them from this? That they enjoy the decor of expensive hotels? Wouldn&#39; t, for example, adding a scene earlier in the film showing Carol doing nothing but playing with her daughter Rindy been a better way to build up the emotional stakes?<br/><br/>&quot; Carol&quot; seems to be the kind of film where the subject matter and the reputation of the participants has totally replaced objective assessment of the work itself. <br/><br/>Gay rights are important, Blanchett is a great actor and Haynes is a great director. &quot; Carol&quot; is not an important or great film though, it&#39; s telling the story of an affair without telling us why the affair happened or why we should care. Its reviews seem to be based on what &quot; Carol&quot; should have been, rather than what it actually is. ",4
"A perfect marriage of director and material, I can&#39; t think of anyone else but Todd Haynes for this story of love and desire blossoming in a desert of repression. Set in the era of the McCarthy witchhunts and the post-war obsession with - one might as well call it panic about- gender roles, CAROL is based on a Patricia Highsmith novel. Playwright Phyllis Nagy&#39; s screenplay pays Highsmith the compliment of maintaining the psychological conflicts and complexities. In particular, the character of Carol&#39; s conventional husband, Harge (played by Kyle Chandler) could have, in lesser hands, received much shorter shrift than here. <br/><br/>Beautifully photographed, designed, edited, scored and acted, there&#39; s no reason to give it anything less than full marks. I was completely engrossed by it from start to finish. ",10
"I had the chance to see this movie during the Dutch film festival. <br/><br/>I want to start by saying that this is a &quot; must see&quot; . I am very critical about my lady loving movies, and the way Cate and Rooney portray their characters, and their on screen chemistry is absolutely breathtaking. <br/><br/>Rooney and Cate captured what it&#39; s like to be falling in love. You&#39; ll get taken away with how this all develops and affects their lives. <br/><br/>It&#39; s an easy-going, subtle movie but never gets dull, it keeps you hooked from beginning to end. <br/><br/>Also the parts played by Sarah Paulson and Kyle Chandler are worth mentioning. It&#39; s been a while, if ever, since such a loving movie was released in this genre. ",10
"I had been looking forward to this film for months, and upon finally viewing it- it&#39; s a huge disappointment. Todd Haynes, who&#39; s finest achievement is still Far From Heaven (2002), has a knack for creating intimate atmospheres with radiant colors and backdrops. Like Far from Heaven, he succeeds with the aesthetic values of the 1950s by giving us refined art direction and beautiful costumes. Unlike Far from Heaven, we are given wooden characters and a predictable script, with a score by Carter Burwell that sounds exactly like Philip Glass&#39; s creation for The Hours (2002). <br/><br/>Rooney Mara works in a department store, and finds herself attracted to Cate Blanchett, a well to do married woman who flirts with her while shopping for Christmas presents. Later they have lunch, and in the only truly well acted scene in the film, seem to connect almost instantaneously. The dialogue here is cleverly limited- so we can instead watch the suggestive gestures of both characters that indicate sexual attraction- and tension. It&#39; s too bad this is the only scene I felt was able to capture this. The rest of the movie unfolds like a poorly written episode of the series Mad Men, as the women keep meeting up secretly whilst the husband gets suspicious and even hires a detective to follow them to a hotel so he can later gain custody of Blanchett&#39; s child. This is because homosexuality is &quot; naughty&quot; . <br/><br/>Perhaps the reason I felt bored watching Carol was that the material is old and tired. Sexual repression in the 50s? We&#39; ve seen this so many times. Brokeback Mountain (2005) also dealt with homosexuality with two men- and with much sharper direction and a more interesting story. The actors there were also more believable. Speaking of the acting, Cate Blanchett is indeed the standout. She&#39; s not nearly as strong as I had heard or hoped for, but she&#39; s none the less ravishing and breathtaking to gaze upon. She&#39; s at the peek of her career now, with 2 Oscars under her belt, and indeed Carol should easily earn her a deserved 7th nomination. But besides a juicy scene towards the end, the character isn&#39; t that intriguing. There&#39; s a lot to be desired, and that easily could be the fault of the screenwriter (Phyllis Nagy), who adapted the script. Yes I get it- it&#39; s supposed to be subtle, but this character felt empty. Blanchett is a fine actress- we could have gotten some more fire from her character. <br/><br/>Rooney Mara is even more flat. She relies simply on her pretty face. I kept thinking Natalie Portman would have exuded so much more energy with the role, since both women have similar physical dynamics to their facial structures. Mara just comes off weak. There&#39; s not an ounce of integrity or feeling coming through with this performance. If that&#39; s how she was supposed to play it, then the fault lies in the director. How she won at Cannes is beyond me. She&#39; s not impressive at all. She&#39; s pretty, but that doesn&#39; t constitute good acting. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is easily forgettable. Sarah Paulson has a thankless role, and she&#39; s usually very good (watch her in 12 Years a Slave). Mara&#39; s boyfriend is the worst acting I&#39; ve seen all year; very high school drama club. Everyone else is going through their lines in a robotic tone. <br/><br/>This could have been an exceptional film. And I&#39; m in the minority who didn&#39; t like it (it&#39; s currently one of the top reviewed films of 2015, and destined to be crowned with nominations on Oscar morning). But it left me feeling cold, and bored. I might just be sick of seeing movies about the 1950s and how everyone couldn&#39; t &quot; talk about things like being gay, and sex, and racial relations&quot; back then. The subject has been hammered over my head too many times. But the trailer for this movie was a love letter. Why couldn&#39; t the movie be the same? Mara and Blanchett are supposed to be in love, and yet their first meeting aside- I never really felt a true connection between them. There was never enough juice in their chemistry for me to believe it. ",5
"Apparently, the novel this movie&#39; s based on came out more than half a century ago and the movie version should&#39; ve been released in about half that time in order to be fresh, daring, original or topical. But, today, it&#39; s just out of place. <br/><br/>Sure, Carol, the movie that is, shows us a ton of 1950s women who like to smoke and eat in restaurants. Repeatedly. It&#39; s a wonder none of them coughed once or gained weight since that was the bulk of the film. In between those smoking and eating scenes were dry spells of two character drawn to each other for chance coincidence of two women liking other women. As good of actresses as the leads are, I never bought their chemistry or depth other than they both happened to be lesbians. <br/><br/>Basically – and that&#39; s what this is, basic – two women meet. One rich, the other aimless. One getting divorced, the other clinging onto affection. Suddenly there&#39; s a road trip to clear the title character&#39; s mind after the thought she might lose custody of her child in the divorce. Forced romance ensues andthe rest is spoilers, albeit obvious. <br/><br/>I didn&#39; t find the story compelling, or even interesting enough to care about any of the characters. Rooney Mara&#39; s Therese, the lost one, spends the grand majority of the film just staring off into nothingness while, I suppose, we&#39; re supposed to see depth in her. (Hint: I didn&#39; t. ) Cate Blanchett&#39; s Carol, the richie one, seems to be in another movie, in another room, just reading lines from the script. <br/><br/>It would be easy just to call this movie boring and dismiss it. But, it really is that. Barely anything happens and the stuff that does, I&#39; ve seen countless times before in both gay and straight forbidden love films. Only, those movies had complexity, decent to great cinematography and chemistry between the leadsso we could, you know, root for the forbidden love. <br/><br/>Hell, this one was so dry, I was only told the mother, Carol, is heartbroken she can&#39; t see her child after the divorce. I never once believed Carol couldn&#39; t live without her daughter. She was, again, just reading her lines. <br/><br/>Sadly, I don&#39; t have much positive to say about this. I wanted to like Blanchett, as I almost always do, but I didn&#39; t. I wanted to marvel, once again, at Mara, but she seemed as lost as her character. I did, however, really like the ex-lover character of Abby, played by the wonderful American Horror Story regular, Sarah Paulson. She would be my only vote here for an award nomination. But, even then, I wouldn&#39; t be voting for her underused part. <br/><br/>I didn&#39; t hate this, or even really dislike it that much. I would&#39; ve had to care more to think that hard on it. It&#39; s just a movie I do regret seeing and won&#39; t be visiting Carol again. ",2
"These days, it&#39; s hard to be surprised by a love story in a film. There shouldn&#39; t even be much of a surprise to the love story that forms the heart and soul of CAROL – anyone who walks into the cinema will know that this is The Movie In Which Cate Blanchett And Rooney Mara Play Lesbians. And yet, Todd Haynes&#39; masterful, intoxicating film unfolds in a series of small, subtle surprises, culminating in one of the most profoundly affecting romances ever committed to film. <br/><br/>New York, in the early 1950s. Therese (Mara) is working as a shopgirl in the toy section of a department store. She meets and serves dozens of people, but only one catches her eye: Carol (Blanchett), a poised, polished and seemingly perfect example of the many wives and mothers who frequent the store. On Therese&#39; s recommendation, Carol buys a model train set for her daughter Rindy: an unusual Christmas present for a little girl that swiftly draws a connection between the two women. <br/><br/>Over the next hour, CAROL shades colour and complexity into the world in which Carol and Therese live. When they find each other again through a pair of gloves misplaced by accident (or, perhaps, design), the two women share lunch, and a tune played on a piano. Carol invites Therese to her family home and, eventually, on a road trip that changes everything. Therese confesses her love of photography, and begins to ask awkward questions of Richard (Jake Lacy), her devoted, if somewhat callous, boyfriend. Through it all, Carol&#39; s marriage to Harge (Kyle Chandler) crumbles apart, despite the fierce love they share for their daughter. <br/><br/>For much of its running time, Haynes&#39; film – an adaptation of Patricia Highsmith&#39; s groundbreaking second novel, The Price Of Salt – unfolds at a deliberately unhurried pace that might alienate some, and bore others. Dramatic outbursts are kept to a bare minimum, chiefly coming from a raging Harge as he tries ever more desperately to cajole (or bully) Carol into remaining by his side. The growing tenderness between Carol and Therese deepens, not through flowery confessions of undying love, but in the exchanging of tentative glimpses, glances and smiles. <br/><br/>And yet, the heartbreaking magic woven throughout CAROL comes from precisely these understated, measured moments. The aching, all- consuming affection between Carol and Therese blossoms in the film&#39; s pockets of silence, as they study each other in a mirror, or share a conspiratorial smile over breakfast. Threats of death and danger surface, but in purely emotional terms, resonating all the more powerfully for never being literal. Indeed, it&#39; s only when the film slips into its devastating final act – which simultaneously manages to warm hearts and shatter souls – that one begins to realise just how bewitching a spell CAROL has cast in the silences and in-betweens. <br/><br/>To top it all off, there is so much at work in Phyllis Nagy&#39; s wonderfully spare script that CAROL practically begs to be excavated, pored over and studied at length. The love story at its heart works because CAROL is a film about two women who are making their way towards each other through a world that often refuses to understand, accept or acknowledge them: not just as potential lovers, but also as people. Entire novels can be written about the film&#39; s excellent feminist and queer credentials, particularly when it comes to shining a spotlight on its women and their relationships (including a powerful supporting turn by Sarah Paulson as Abby, Carol&#39; s best friend and erstwhile paramour). <br/><br/>It seems profoundly unnecessary to say that CAROL&#39; s trump card is Blanchett. It should be self-evident, a given – after all, for as long as she has made movies, she has unquestionably been the best thing about any film she&#39; s in. And yet, she is completely transcendent here. In Blanchett&#39; s hands, Carol manages to be unearthly – an exalted goddess on a pedestal – and utterly, completely human at the same time. In a wonderfully layered final scene with Harge, Carol&#39; s controlled composure cracks apart, revealing the punishing depth of the pain she must undergo in order to be true to herself. Blanchett conveys it all with heartbreak to spare, radiating love, joy, misery or despair with barely perceptible changes in expression. <br/><br/>Mara, meanwhile, gives her finest performance to date. Her Therese lingers quietly at the edges of her own life, not so much pushing limits as slipping past them to find her own way. It&#39; s hard to shake the feeling, though, that Mara remains outclassed by her co-star. Unlike Carol, Therese never completely coalesces as a character in her own right. To be fair to Mara, that&#39; s partly due to one of the script&#39; s few flaws. In a film that is otherwise so subtle and considered, we are too often told rather than shown that Carol finds Therese irresistible. (There is no such problem in believing that anyone could fall head over heels for Carol. ) <br/><br/>Nevertheless, the chemistry between Blanchett and Mara burns, slowly but brightly. The electricity between them throws off more sparks as the film goes on – to the point that audiences will find their hearts stuttering and stopping at the tiniest of moments: when Carol presses her hand lightly on Therese&#39; s shoulder, or when their eyes meet, finally, across a crowded room. <br/><br/>In all of these elements, and in ways big and small, CAROL constantly surprises. It could have been ripely melodramatic; instead, it lingers in a key of melancholy realism. In another universe, Carol might have been more manipulative, Harge more villainous, Therese more coquettish, the love story less compelling and more titillating. The film&#39; s themes could have overwhelmed its central romance. And yet, in every gorgeous frame (composed with impeccable grace by cinematographer Edward Lachman), CAROL sings of its love story: one that is as sweet as it is bitter, as simple as it is complex, and as real as it is magical. ",9
"I&#39; ll try to be brief, since the film wasn&#39; t. <br/><br/>Visually, this was a satisfying film to watch. Like looking through an old photo album from the 1950s, beautifully shot. <br/><br/>Narratively, it was an utterly predictable story, without a single twist, every plot point telegraphed and seen miles in advance. <br/><br/>Rooney, reminiscent of a beautifully boyish young Demi Moore, was quite good, though her character&#39; s relationship to the boyfriend Richard was not particularly nuanced. A little more ambivalence on her character&#39; s part toward the relationship would&#39; ve created some needed tension. <br/><br/>Blanchet was interesting, but in a one-dimensional kind of way. She was beautiful, but her manner and delivery seemed superficial and artificial. I&#39; m a bit undecided as to whether these were traits with which she was intentionally trying to imbue the character of Carol, or whether this is how she plays all her characters. <br/><br/>This is a mainstream drama, a vehicle for the stars to garner Oscar nominations. A far cry from Haynes&#39; far superior Far From Heaven, however. Watchable, for sure, but for me only once. ",5
"&#39; Carol&#39; is a fine film. The juxtaposition of the lavish costumes and production design with the grainy look of 16mm film sells the film&#39; s old-fashioned aesthetic. It is a well-shot film that is pleasant to look at. All of the individual performances are pretty good. <br/><br/>The best part of the film is the opening sequence. The credits play over a continuing shot of fifties New York accompanied by Carter Burwell&#39; s fantastic piece &#39; Opening&#39; . This shot brings us to a scene in a restaurant. This is a flash-forward that we revisit later on in the film. Our first sight of the main couple occurs when a man at the bar looks around the restaurant and spots them at a table. In this shot, Therese (Rooney Mara) and Carol (Cate Blanchett) are sitting at a table. Therese is sat facing away from the camera and towards Carol, who we can see clearly. My immediate reaction to this sight was &quot; Wow, Cate Blanchett genuinely looks like she&#39; s in love. &quot; It felt real. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I didn&#39; t get this feeling from the rest of the film. I couldn&#39; t feel any chemistry between Therese and Carol. Mara and Blanchett do their best with what they are given, but they aren&#39; t given enough. Their characters don&#39; t feel fleshed out. I didn&#39; t feel like I knew them as people by the end. The film&#39; s technical achievements can only lift a film so high. If you love this film then I&#39; m glad, but I can&#39; t love it when I couldn&#39; t grow attached to the characters. This is especially a problem as this feels like a film driven more by character than by story. <br/><br/>Despite what I have said, this film didn&#39; t bore me. Mara and Blanchett are both engaging actresses who command your attention even if they aren&#39; t given enough to work with. The film is on the slow side but it goes at the right pace for what director Todd Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy were going for. Overall, it was an interesting experience that felt a bit empty. <br/><br/>You can see more reviews at http: //letterboxd. com/lloyd_morgan/films/reviews/",7
"I&#39; m at a loss with this movie. I went to the late showing last night, which was a mistake because this drama about two lovers persecuted by ignorance and misogyny will exploit any fatigue you have and try desperately to put you to sleep. I struggle through nearly two hours of this movie and eventually gave up and left figuring that not much else would happen as nothing did happen throughout the entire first three quarters. I went and read some spoiler discussion on it on a clickbait website to find that I didn&#39; t miss much. <br/><br/>Don&#39; t get me wrong, these actresses are at the top of their game with strong performances by both lead Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara. It&#39; s the script that seems dull to me. The drama and romance appear so distant and tension so boring that it was nearly impossible to get close to these characters and care.

"If you have watched your fair share of lesbian movies, you&#39; ll understand the thirst for a lesbian love story that is well made and Carol pretty much is that game changer we&#39; ve all been waiting for. <br/><br/>I won&#39; t give away too many spoilers because this movie is already quite predictable. It&#39; s a love story set in the 1950&#39; s America where homosexual romances were obviously forbidden so things can&#39; t get anymore surprising than that. There are a couple little unexpected moments here and there that formed the overall arc regarding Carol&#39; s battle over the custody of her daughter but other than that, this movie is quite slow-paced. Though, I would note that that is a good thing. It is this slow revelation that makes several key scenes very rewarding. One of which was the love scene. Having read the book, I was already aware that it would be like that so it wasn&#39; t particularly a big deal for me. <br/><br/>One thing I have always believed about this story just out of reading the book is that the storyline is quite simple. You have these two women falling in love with each other only to have a certain obstacle befall them but it is the complexity of their characters and what polar opposites of one another they are that feels the most intricate. Screenwriter, Phyllis Nagy did a great job honouring her late friend, author, Patricia Highsmith&#39; s book and it was evidently captured on screen with how much the movie felt like it was just as if though it had been any ordinary heteronormative film we see today. <br/><br/>Then there&#39; s Todd Haynes. I have never seen anything he has directed before but I&#39; m sure the hype is valid because the direction and overall cinematography of this film was simply magnificent and a pleasure to watch. I was completely enraptured by every scene. I know many people have raved about how gorgeous this film was and I can&#39; t add anything more to that because that is pretty much the only word that does it justice. <br/><br/>Carter Burwell&#39; s score although repetitive at times was evocatively divine and meshed well with the era of the film. I would have loved if the piano theme song that played in the trailer had been in the film at some point. <br/><br/>Cate Blanchett as per usual is marvellous in this role. She is THE Carol that I have read in the book and she handles her character with such dexterity, going from steely cold and intimidating to a hopeless romantic/passionate lover and then to a desperate mother fighting for her child with such grace and poise. Rooney Mara on the other hand is rather spellbinding in this although I am sure I could imagine someone else as Therese too if I wanted. It is probably the fault with the character as it dwarfs opposite Carol. The supporting actors are worth mentioning too as Kyle Chandler and Sarah Paulson never fail to impress each time they are on screen albeit how little screen time they both had. <br/><br/>Which leads me to the ending and probably the most spoiler-ish part of the review. The ending is really the reason why this movie is getting plenty of Oscar buzz or so I think. It is the way that Todd was able to translate onto the big screen that crucial moment in the culmination of the story that left us, the audience speechless and wanting to know more when it cuts to black. The way he makes it feel like we were Therese looking at Carol and the way that he captured Carol looking over at her in those final close-on shots of her. My heart raced in that moment. It was only interpretive of one thing. A happy ending for a lesbian story that we have all been holding out for and it was done so perfectly. <br/><br/>&quot; That&#39; s that. &quot; ",8
"I dunno if the people reviewing this even saw the same film, or if they&#39; re just studio execs boosting their own movies reviews for the sake of winning the upcoming awards, but this movie is garbage. Far from being academy award winning imo. <br/><br/>Cinematography: The director repeats the same shots of someone making overdramatic facial expressions through frosted glass through the entire film. It loses its effect after the 10th time, and by the end of the film its just plain annoying. As far as crafting a 50sesque feel, they succeeded. This film even looks like it was made in the 50s. Unlike the ever famous Madmen though, this is not a good thing<br/><br/>Storytelling: As I said in the summary line, this story moves slower than a snail caught in tar. From the getgo, it becomes obvious there is a lesbian affair going on here, but for the next hour plus, the plot never develops into anything more than this. In fact, we never even see any actual physical romance between the 2 leads. <br/><br/>Acting: I felt it got over the top a few times. Kate Blanchett is the type of actress that forgets shes not on the Broadway theater when shes doing cinema, and it can be really ridiculous at times. This is one of those times. <br/><br/>TL; dr version: this movie is a complete waste of time and the plot summary sums up the entire film to the point where you literally don&#39; t even need to watch it",1
"The movie &quot; Carol, &quot; a lesbian romantic drama that is based on the book &quot; The Price of Salt&quot; by Patricia Highsmith, is getting named Best Film of the Year by just about everyone, it seems, and making all the award short-lists. And Helen is Highly disappointed. Let me add up front that the film was costumed by Sandy Powell, art directed by Jesse Rosenthal, and filmed by Edward Lachman, who will all likely (and deservingly) receive awards for their work here. But I have issues with director Todd Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy. <br/><br/>I saw &quot; Carol&quot; at the New York Film Festival, where just about every film was more interesting than this gigantic slice of Boring. After watching the film, I assumed most people would dislike it as much as I did, so I was shocked when I did a quick Google search and saw the Variety review pop up saying &quot; High expectations don&#39; t quite prepare you for the startling impact of Carol, exquisitely drawn, deeply felt&quot; No way! My first order of business is to change Variety&#39; s intro line: &quot; High expectations don&#39; t quite prepare you for&quot; : the slow emptiness of this mundane, overly precious, pointlessly detailed movie. <br/><br/>Listen, I adore Cate Blanchett as much as anyone. And no one can say she is not gorgeous. At one point in the film – at a party, her estranged husband concedes to her that she is the most beautiful woman in the room. Well, that never changes. She is the most beautiful and the best dressed and best groomed person in every scene. So, let&#39; s all agree to put Cate Blanchett&#39; s face in the dictionary under the word Perfection, and then we can all go home and save ourselves two hours of lifeless artifice. And if Cate were selling lipstick, or stockings, or fur coats, I would buy them all. But I would not recommend this movie to anyone. <br/><br/>I&#39; m happy for Cate that she got such a glamorous star vehicle in which to show off. But why is no one else stating the obvious – that this is essentially a vanity project for Cate Blanchett? Unfortunately however, in this movie, we cannot see Cate&#39; s rich inner life through her the heavy cover of makeup and fur. Remember the episode on &quot; Mad Men, &quot; where Don Draper is trying desperately to find the ideal, alluring model to put in his fur coat ad? Todd Haynes&#39; Cate Blanchett should get that job! She is precisely what Don was looking for – an impossibly beautiful fantasy of aspirational glamor and exquisite opulence. Women want to be her and men want to have her exactly because she is so flawless and empty; you feel nothing for her as a character – no complicated emotions to ruin the high-gloss illusion. And honestly, Cate, you are better than this; you don&#39; t need to advertise your quintessential (surface) beauty. That Don Draper gig, and this movie, are beneath you; you can act. <br/><br/>This brings me to the lesbian theme of the story. Helen Highly objects to the portrayal of Carol and her younger lover (played by Rooney Mara) as a Hollywood male fantasy of woman-on-woman sexuality. Due to Haynes&#39; decision to maintain the look-and-feel of a 1950s flick, the movie refrains from overtly explicit sex scenes, but still it has the tone of cheesy pin-up porn – made for men, and not about real-life women who have ambiguous thoughts and difficult feelings. Highsmith&#39; s 1953 book, &quot; The Price of Salt, &quot; became a lesbian-romance cult-novel, due largely to its being the first authentic expression of lesbian love that did not have the punishing ending that was prescribed by 1950s morality. Highsmith was a lesbian herself (a fact she denied throughout most of her career), and this story is semi-autobiographical, telling the tale of when she was a shop girl who fell into a romantic obsession over an older married woman who was a customer at the store. But let&#39; s stop there for a moment. (Well, there&#39; s not much else to tell; the movie mostly repeats variations of the first scene. )<br/><br/>So many people are eager to say how this film is &quot; important for women&quot; – as if it were still the act of sexual bravery and social revelation it was in the 1950s. And that is simply not the case. Today, the storyline is outdated. The book was ground-breaking and radical; the movie is conventional and banal. And this is the fault of the screenplay, which does not capture the emotional intensity or poetic eroticism of the book. <br/><br/>The book meticulously detailed the interior lives of these two, passionate yet confused women; the film, instead, meticulously and ploddingly details a story that was only loosely referenced in the book (because Highsmith was interested in tortuous desire and fearful loneliness, not a who-gets-the-kid divorce case). In the movie that Nagy and Haynes made, the tale becomes a simplistic, self-righteous, politically-correct after-school-movie. Haynes attempts, it seems, to depict the women&#39; s emotions with an endless series of long, still- life gazes. And so it seems that Haynes cares more about his visual style than he does the psychology of his characters. And to those who like to say that &quot; Carol&quot; is comparable to &quot; Strangers on a Train, &quot; I say: Yes, Hitchcock and Highsmith shared an affection for frosty blonds (perhaps Todd Haynes does as well). But Haynes is no Hitchcock. (And &quot; Carol&quot; is no thriller. ) Hitchcock knew how to make an ice-queen come alive on the screen, BUT he also understood plot; he knew what was a compelling story and what was not. &quot; Carol&quot; is not. So, Cate Blanchett and Todd Haynes can wish she were Grace Kelly or Kim Novak all day long, but she&#39; s not going to touch a hair of their blond locks with this script and this director. ",2
"In 1950s America, Carol is nearing the end of a quietly unhappy marriage to Harge, and trying to retain custody of their daughter Rindy. There is a morality clause and Carol&#39; s lesbian tendencies bring this to bear, especially when she falls for Therese, and a relationship gradually begins to blossom. <br/><br/>I was expecting great things from this film: Cate Blanchett as Carol and Rooney Mara as Therese have both been getting glowing notices. And those notices are richly deserved: both women are first rate. I wish I could say the same for the film. There are two strong plot elements here: the legal wrangle and the growing (and forbidden) relationship. The film should have been electrifying. But it is slow and, regrettably, boring. I know that you don&#39; t have to take a film at breakneck speed but, given the drama inherent in the two major plot threads, not only does not very much happen, it happens very slowly. <br/><br/>I&#39; m sure this will be up for bags of awards (I get the impression that it regards itself as Important), but I was disappointed. ",6
"Unlike the sentimental melodrama &quot; Brooklyn, &quot; Director Todd Haynes has fashioned a more salacious tale based on Patricia Highsmith&#39; s 1952 novel &quot; The Price of Salt&quot; (later named &quot; Carol&quot; ). Like his predecessor, Douglas Sirk, the grandmaster of the 1950s melodrama, you can always count on Haynes to deliver the goods in terms of brilliant cinematography, bravura acting (this time provided by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara) as well as a production design that magnificently recreates the heady days of the early 1950s, just as Dwight D. Eisenhower ascends the &quot; throne&quot; of the American presidency for the first time. Despite all the positives, why then is &quot; Carol&quot; simply &quot; average&quot; and mediocre to boot?<br/><br/>When Highsmith&#39; s novel came out in 1952, a lesbian romance was considered fairly scandalous. Indeed, when the film&#39; s protagonist, Carol Aird, begins a lesbian affair with salesgirl Therese Belivet, the villain of the piece, Carol&#39; s rather mean and pathetic husband, Harge, invokes a &quot; morality clause, &quot; permitting him to gain full custody of the couple&#39; s young daughter, Rindy, without the possibility of Carol having any visitation rights. <br/><br/>Carol&#39; s ensuing decision to get away from it all and inviting Therese on a sensual whirlwind of a cross country car trip may have been shocking for 1950s readers, but today it feels like old hat. We&#39; re supposed to get excited about the two lovers&#39; intense desire for one another but what&#39; s so original about a lesbian romance? It&#39; s simply not enough on which to hang your hat on for an entire movie. True, at the midpoint, there is a welcome plot twist involving Harge, who hires a private investigator to tape record Carol and Therese as they make love in the &quot; presidential suite&quot; of a cheap motel. <br/><br/>But what happens after that? Spoilers AHEAD. Carol goes back to Harge but eventually (wouldn&#39; t you know it?) is unable to shake her love and lust for dear Therese, and it&#39; s postulated at the climax that indeed they will once again reunite. The uncreative ending -- which really needed some kind of extraordinary twist -- leaves the two lovers staring at one another in a fancy hotel restaurant, as the screen fades to black. I suppose the non-stop &quot; passion&quot; between the two principals is what has seduced both critics and the average film-goer alike into declaring that this is some kind of masterpiece. But in reality Mr. Haynes should be applauded only for creating an impressive atmosphere— mere attraction (no matter how intense it is), is not enough for us to care about characters that are in need of much more detailed development.

"I saw the movie Carol and am extremely disappointed. Cate Blanchett as Carol was stylish. Screenplay is very weak. There is very little conversation between Carol and Therese (Rooney Mara). The movie is too long. The scenes are dragged. There is no substance in the movie. Cate Blanchett was great in movies Notes on a scandal and of course Blue Jasmine. In this movie , her style is obvious in her clothes, in her voice , in her gait but there are no dialog or conversation. The movie is poorly edited . I did not enjoy the movie. Rooney Mara was good . Rooney Mara&#39; s role was better than Cates Blanchett role. But on the whole, not even nomination worthy. Really boring movie. Weak. ",3
"I&#39; m a 17 year old male teenager who happened to stumble upon this movie two years ago at school during a free day in math class (when I was 15). I liked it then, but the math class ended before the movie could be finished. Finally, on the WB a few days ago, the movie aired and I saw the conclusion. AWTR contains a heartfelt conclusion to a story where you get to care about Landon and Jamie, two polar opposite teenagers who face peer struggles and the perils of love and death. The situations that occur are very real, and very sad. Once the movie finishes, you&#39; ll be left wondering what happens to everyone (heck, even though it doesn&#39; t make sense, I want a sequel!). <br/><br/>As a maturing male, I couldn&#39; t help but cry inside, and I&#39; m someone who felt indifferent toward movies like Titanic. I found myself wishing I were either Landon or Jamie, because they represent the real virtues of life and love. Aside from the movie&#39; s undying message, there are some slight flaws. The ending could have been expanded a bit more (you&#39; ll see when you watch it as I don&#39; t want to spoil anything) to include more emotion. Otherwise, the acting done by Mandy Moore and Shane West is superb and top notch - these two actors have quite the career ahead of them. You&#39; ll see as these two characters develop that you can&#39; t imagine any other people doing the job. <br/><br/>This isn&#39; t your typical love story, because when it comes down to it, the love is only part of the whole scheme. While I never expected this to touch me so much, AWTR enters as perhaps my favorite movie of all time. You will feel as if you&#39; re a part of the movie, you will be able to relate to them, and you will love it. AWTR succeeds in delivering a great experience. Available on DVD now, you&#39; ll be wishing the release had deleted scenes, et. all. Highly recommended. ",10
"This was one of the best films I&#39; ve seen lately. Mandy Moore shone in her role as Jamie Sullivan, although never to the point where she became unbelievable. Her singing was fabulous, but it was clear that this was not a film about her singing - too many pop artists starring in films wind up in films about their pop careers, whether real or inferred. <br/><br/>The storyline was VERY good. I can&#39; t say too much without spoiling it for everyone else, but take my word for it. You absolutely must watch this film at some point - make sure you grab plenty of tissues though, because if you don&#39; t get emotional towards the end, you must have a heart of stone. <br/><br/>All in all, fantastic. ",8
"I can not say that A Walk to Remember was a movie that I went out of my way to see, or even that I recall it being aired in any UK cinema. I happened to watch it on TV one Sunday morning expecting something somewhat usual and predictable. <br/><br/>I must admit I was more than pleasantly surprised, enough so to actually watch it more than once, and consequently feel compelled to write these comments. I find myself struggling not to watch it whenever I see it listed, such a charming movie is this! The plot seems to be initially a rather predictable foray into the traditional territory of bad boy meets good, but sadly plain girl. At some point in the movie, girl momentarily transforms from ugly duckling into swan. At this point I found myself feeling that comfort that we all feel in the knowledge that we know exactly what is going to happen in a movie. I was entirely convinced that the entire culmination of the thing is for girl to gain some peer group acceptance. The presence of a seemingly overly protective father hints at overtones that he may be some kind of parental tyrant figure from whom she may require some sort of heroic liberation. <br/><br/>However as Jaime reveals her secret then all becomes apparent, and a far more absorbing plot unfolds than is initially to be expected. <br/><br/>Performances are competent and heartfelt, Shane West gives an admirable portrayal of an angry young man on a path of reformation. Mandy Moore is strong and almost graceful in her role as Jaime and enhances the charm of this romantic interlude with several pretty vocal solos. <br/><br/>Daryl Hannah and Peter Coyote both fine actors add a lovely depth to the general proceedings and are certainly worth a mention for their respective roles as concerned parents. <br/><br/>It is impossible for me not to like this little film, because I am an insufferably romantic female and A walk to Remember has romance in a monumental dosage. There is little or no sexual content, rather emphasis is put upon the more admirable and sincere aspects of courtship little seen in the average teen movie. <br/><br/>Without going into territory that could be classed as spoiling, it is worth mentioning that some people may place A Walk to Remember into the tear- jerker category, and consign it to a dark dusty corner of their DVD collection which is only delved into in the most girly of moments. <br/><br/>For some, several scenes may be a little too saccharine- but if you don&#39; t like romance then this picture probably isn&#39; t for you anyway. <br/><br/>In my opinion, this category is a little too narrow to slide A Walk to Remember into. The true themes of this lovely story are in reality- faith, and redemption, which are universal aspects of humanity with which we can all identify in various amount. <br/><br/>The end result for me was that I felt uplifted at the end. Like eating a tub of ice cream or having a nice bubbly bath this is a movie to put on when you feel low or have had a bad day and it&#39; s sure to make you feel much better. You will fall in love for the first time all over again for a couple of hours. <br/><br/>You may well sit down to watch with preconceptions about what you are going to see. You men may sit down and watch it solely to win a few merit points from your girlfriend so she&#39; ll let you watch the football in peace later. As my title says though, this may be the one romantic movie you will hate yourself for loving. <br/><br/>You don&#39; t even have to admit to anybody that you watched it and liked it, but I encourage you to watch it all the same without prejudice. <br/><br/>A little charmer- comforting and sweet- sets out to do something very simple, and delivers well, I give 7/10",7
"Let&#39; s get this straight: <br/><br/>It&#39; s not an artistically excellent movie. It is not a movie with performances that are going to constitute landmarks in the acting profession. It is not a movie with high-end special effects, storming action or astounding scenery. It is not a story that copes with the deepest causes of adolescent misbehavior / frustration / desperation in the sense of a purely sociological cinematography. It can be characterised light (although it includes sadness as a feeling) and shallow (because in its limited duration the director does not have the convenience of &quot; looking&quot; deeper into the characters and - at the same time - include an extensive plot which must be given in order to see a considerable change in Landon&#39; s personality) <br/><br/>I could go on giving cons about this film but I am sure you can find many in previously posted negative reviews - and many of these reviews, more or less, hit some quite substantial spots about the film. BUT. . . <br/><br/>I gave it 10 out of 10 for a single simple reason: whatever its flaws, it made me cry unashamedly and that&#39; s something that not a lot of movies can claim, in all honesty. And despite the sadness it inevitably brings (which is not necessarily bad) it also brings innocence, sweetness, optimism - yes, that too - and faith in life and love and the ability of every single person for change, the ability - and the obligation - to become better. It is a movie-edition of an adorable book, and as always, it cannot be better than the book. However, in its own scope it brings out the message quite clearly, quite beautifully, and quite optimistically. It is a film that I have watched repeatedly and will continue to watch with joy. And melancholy. ",10
"What can I say? it&#39; s one of my favorite movies. It has everything: love, romance, action, sorrow, and happiness. Shane West and Mandy Moore have wonderful chemistry together, and it shows. It makes you feel like you want to become a better person, and not be so selfish, self-centered, and makes you realize that there more important things in life. <br/><br/>Another reason why it&#39; s such a great movie is because you see the transition of someone who I guess you can say was &quot; heading on the wrong path&quot; given another chance to make something out of themselves, and that makes you feel good. You have to give a lot of credit to the young main actors in the film (Mandy Moore and Shane West) they did a great job for both of them just starting their movie careers only a couple of years ago. <br/><br/>Although for anyone that has actually read the book, like myself, you catch a lot of the differences between the book and the movie, and in your own way you can note what could have made the film a lot better than how good it was. This was definitely Mandy Moore&#39; s best movie, and think it left a big positive mark for her in having a acting career. I undoubtedly give this movie 4 1/2 stars out 5. ",10
"After seeing this movie today, I walked out of the theater in tears. Jamie and Landon create a miracle. Landon lacks faith in himself, in the wonder of life and in God. Jamie has the faith that Landon lacks. <br/><br/>Teen peer group pressure in the form of a dare causes a young man to be hospitalized. Landon is partially responsible. His punishment is dealt out by the school principal. The principal wants to somehow reach him, to teach him humility. Landon has to do math tutoring for resistant kids, perform janitorial duties around his high school, and perform in the school play. <br/><br/>He&#39; s known Jamie all his life. However, his attitude as a cool kid, is to ignore her in public. But due to his community service responsibilities he really gets to know her. And he needs her help in rehearsing his lines for the school play. Through working on the play, Landon starts to fall in love with Jamie. He is softened. He sees her faith. She develops faith in him, and he then finds faith in himself. Mandy reaches her audience in portraying a ministers daughter whose faith helps her to resist peer pressure. <br/><br/>Why she warns Landon not to fall in love with her. . . that&#39; s the point of the movie. The movie will help remind people of the value of life and of simple things!<br/><br/>I give this 5 stars! But I&#39; m a sentimental guy who likes romantic movies. ",10
"I saw this movie last Sunday night, and I have to say that I was deeply moved by it. I do not think that it had the cliches of teen films at all. If anything, the movie has a new perspective on teen love. Teen films today are mostly focused on &quot; getting laid&quot; or &quot; turning the ugly girl pretty&quot; (one way or another), just rent American Pie or She&#39; s All That. Not that there isn&#39; t a special place in my heart for these movies, but A Walk To Remember is in a class all by itself. The movie did have it&#39; s share of cheesy moments, due mostly to the overbearing dramatic musical score in certain scenes. Other than that, the characters were very genuine and the performances were most definitely heartfelt. Mandy Moore definitely holds her own in this movie as Jamie Sullivan, showing lots of emotional depth and making a complete transformation from teen pop goddess to modest southern girl. Shane West is a talent that should not be overlooked by Hollywood. He gets better and better in every film that he&#39; s in. He can do comedy (watch his underrated supporting comedic role in &quot; Get Over It&quot; ), and he tackles drama with ease in this film. Great supporting turns from Peter Coyote as Jamie&#39; s father, and from an aged Darryl Hannah as Landon&#39; s mother. <br/><br/>On to the topic of this review. This movie is not for cynical people, or people who do not believe in love. This movie&#39; s core message is that love can and will conquer all obstacles. This is a movie about teens who love each other in a very adult way. I can relate because I have had the same girlfriend for the past two years, ever since my senior year in high school. We love each other immensely, and we believe that we have a deep connection. People didn&#39; t think that we would last, because we just didn&#39; t act like all the other teen couples on campus. So when Landon would say these deeply loving things to Jamie in the movie, I cried because someone had said the same things I had said not too long ago to my girlfriend. So, if you don&#39; t believe in love, don&#39; t see this movie because you won&#39; t like it. <br/><br/>If you have a bitterness toward religion, especially Christianity, don&#39; t see this movie, because you will just be bellyaching about the manipulation of religion on the youth of America. I am a Christian, not a hardcore one, but I do believe in God. There are Christian overtones in this movie, faith is spoken of many times in this movie, and faith is the cornerstone of Landon and Jamie&#39; s love. This movie is not preachy, it does not try to hammer home topics of Christianity with words. The movie prefers to use examples in real life situations and medaphors as well. <br/><br/>I have to say thank you to the director and writer for not including a sex scene or a drunken teen party scene in this movie. It is a tasteful family film, and I&#39; m glad it did not try to be too adult with it&#39; s content. The love that Landon and Jamie share is pure, and it is what makes their relationship unique in comparison to the other kids in their town. <br/><br/>People may hate this movie because of the amount of sap or cheesiness. Well, I think the movie is very sugary and sweet, and has plenty of sap. But it is realistic sap. The situations warrant that amount of sap. You wouldn&#39; t make a scene where a guy is confessing his love for his lady all dark and gritty, would you? This movie also does have its share of grit, especially in relation to Landon&#39; s transformation. But you&#39; ll have to see the movie for that. <br/><br/>People may also think that Mandy Moore is not believable in the role of Jamie Sullivan. This is complete hogwash. The point wasn&#39; t to make Jamie a real &quot; ugly duckling&quot; , but a swan who does not care to spread her wings and show off for the rest of the world. Jamie carries a wisdom manifested from her faith and her life experiences. But her peers can&#39; t seem to get past her clothing choices and hairstyles to take her seriously. I just wish that in real life, people wouldn&#39; t look at beautiful as the equivalent of popular and ugly as the exact opposite. I knew quite a few beautiful girls in high school that sat at the back of the cafeteria and read books or did homework. That&#39; s just the sort of life they chose to lead, not because they were forced into it by being picked on, but because they simply existed on a different level. Jamie is exactly that type of person. Landon is that way too, but he just doesn&#39; t want to find that out, until he meets Jamie. <br/><br/>Bottom line, you may love this movie for many reasons, or hate it for many more. This is a movie about soul mates. This is a movie about believing in people, especially in the ones you love. This is a movie about tolerance and not judging a book by its cover. This is a movie about friendship. This is a movie about two people who know they are right for each other. But most importantly, this is a movie about how true love can lift up even the most unreachable souls in this world, and save their lives. <br/><br/>I give this movie a 9 out of 10. ",9
"I have nothing negative to say about A Walk to Remember. Its few &quot; cons&quot; are totally overpowered by the sheer wonder and sincerity of this remarkable film, perhaps one of the best ever emanating from Hollywood and Warner Brothers – a monumental feat given its small production budget. The subtle power of this film keeps one thinking about it continuously and wanting to see it multiple times. It&#39; s a wonderful story about growing up and how one special person can change you forever. It shows how deeply loving someone can transform you to gain the strength to forgive, to accept, to respect, and to accomplish that which you heretofore would never consider. This movie conveys what true love really is, how it can affect people in life and death, and how absolutely beautiful it can be for those lucky enough to experience its deepest level. <br/><br/>The movie is so caring and sincere, it subtly draws you into it. It shows a popular in-crowd teenage boy discovering there is much more to life than reckless, carefree, aimless behavior. When a stupid prank turns harmful, a perpetrator, Landon (one lead character played by Shane West) is &quot; sentenced&quot; to perform community service activities, and these bring him into close contact with Jamie, a non-cool, non-popular nerdy religious girl (the other lead character played by Mandy Moore), who performs the same activities -- by choice. Landon has heretofore always treated Jamie with ridicule and disdain. Though he&#39; s known her all his life, through their interaction he suddenly discovers her passion for life, with interests and a depth he never knew existed. He begins to find a new path for his own life, and the ensuing transformation is wonderfully portrayed. <br/><br/>Although the picture&#39; s main theme is about Landon and the transformation he undergoes, Jamie is clearly the &quot; anchor&quot; of this movie. She&#39; s exceptionally sweet, genuine, innocent, highly intelligent and passionate. She was so interested in astronomy, that she built her own telescope and would venture into their small town cemetery, in the middle of the night, to pursue her celestial passion. She did this, not to impress, but for its own sake. Her beliefs in herself are solid and she never changes. She wears no makeup and wears the same low-key, non-fashionable baggy clothes from the beginning, throughout and to the end of the picture. She actually likes who she is -- the way she is. Unlike Landon, her self-image is not based on what others think. <br/><br/>She has just enough attitude to not take any disingenuousness from anyone – and when being &quot; toyed&quot; with would often &quot; fire&quot; right back. When Dean (a friend of Landon&#39; s and leader of the in-crowd &quot; pack&quot; ) mockingly asked her why her &quot; Higher Power&quot; could not get her a new sweater (she always wore the same one), she responded, &quot; He&#39; s too busy looking for your brain. &quot; When Landon humiliated her in front of his peers, she coolly walked away at the time, but when he later came to her for help she calmly slammed the door in his very surprised face. She&#39; s a strong figure that &quot; sees through&quot; the behavior and demeanor of her peers. Her role demonstrates how one individual of virtue, faith and an up-beat attitude can so positively influence those around her by simply living her life true to her own beliefs, and not succumbing to peer pressure forces, no matter how difficult. <br/><br/>Landon&#39; s role clearly demonstrates the power of forgiveness and how its redemptive qualities can bring about caring unselfish behavior. Landon&#39; s in-crowd peers, treating Jamie cruelly at every opportunity (and eventually ostracizing him when he defended her), were eventually forgiven by Landon, and when tragedy struck they were all there to offer their support for him (and ask for forgiveness, each in their own way). And in what may be the film&#39; s most touching scene (though there are many), Landon essentially forgives his estranged father for leaving his family for another woman, and thanks him for his considerable support in making it possible for Jamie to return home. <br/><br/>One leaves this movie with a number of messages. The movie teaches to always be open to new experiences and to never &quot; judge a book by its cover. &quot; The strongest message, however, is that of being a better more passionate person yourself, and to cherish those around you and the time you have with them. You&#39; re left with a sense of true love being so deep and pure that just being with the one you love brings such wonderful joy to your life. You would do anything for that person, even putting your own happiness aside for the sake of theirs. Jamie was able to change an arrogant, self-absorbed teenager into a tender, loving person who was willing to do virtually anything for her – and did!<br/><br/>Don&#39; t be surprised if you end up falling in love with both Moore&#39; s and West&#39; s characters. The enduring innocence, sweetness, evolving chemistry and eventual deep love between the movie&#39; s leads is genuine, totally heartfelt and compelling – unequaled in any other movie. In the middle of this film are a series of the most incredibly romantic scenes you will ever see in an American firm. They easily flow from scene to beautiful scene, showing two intelligent, thoughtful and sincere people slowly falling for each other. From Casablanca to Love Story to Titanic, no other on-screen pair conveys such an honestly felt passion for each other. <br/><br/>Despite the considerable sadness surrounding their romance, the movie leaves the audience with optimism for life, love, faith and the ability for everyone to change, the possibility to become a better person -- at any age. I watch it repeatedly with both joy and melancholy. Perhaps Pulitzer Prize winner Roger Ebert (renowned longtime Chicago-Sun Times film/TV critic) said it best when he concluded in his film review, &quot; A Walk to Remember is a small treasure. &quot; ",10
"This movie is so indescribable and unique. I have seen it about a million times and I own the DVD, book, posters, and both soundtracks. I am obsessed!In fact, I am watching it right now. Every time I see this movie, without fail, I cry. Yes. . . I will admit I am a hopeless romantic and I love to watch these types of movies. But. . . if there is one thing I hate. . its teeny-bop per movies like Mean Girls, and I also hate it when people say AWTR is one. This movie is most certainly not a teen movie. It is a movie for everyone. . for the older it gives them something to look back on; for the younger, it gives us something to dream of in the future. Partially. . I love this movie because I feel like I am Jamie. And I think it is great to watch a movie that makes you cry and smile all at the same time, and yet come out with such a happy feeling. I recommend this movie for everyone. If you haven&#39; t seen it, I will personally lend it to you. ",10
"Intense, with the intensity of the teenager heart. <br/><br/>Emotional, with the purity of the untainted feelings. <br/><br/>I will miss the day I saw it for the first and last time, since I&#39; m not usually watching any great impact movie again for years. 9 years have passed since then , and the image of the two leading characters is still fresh, my heart is still trembling of emotion and sympathy whenever I remember of this title. There are things that help us live and things we have no desire to live without. <br/><br/>This movie helps us remember that it&#39; s not all about the life&#39; s length, but of its quality as well.

"I am the biggest loser. . . <br/><br/>I&#39; m a 21 year old guy who&#39; s into movies like Van Wilder, Old School, American Pie, Harold and Kumar etc. . . Although, I was quite a Mandy Moore fan in my teens (Britney and Christina never caught on), I went to see A Walk to Remember not expecting much (quality acting, plot etc). <br/><br/>It turns out that the movie wasn&#39; t so bad and Mandy and co. didn&#39; t do such a terrible job that the critics actually said they did. I enjoyed the movie very much (I didn&#39; t cry of nothing&#39; ) but was very sad after the end. <br/><br/>Now I&#39; m not someone who reads a lot of fiction, but after reading The DaVinci Code, I decided to go out and buy A Walk to Remember book (because books always give more detail). This was only a day after watching the movie and I&#39; ll tell you what, by chapter 13, I would have already broken down and cried (or got teary and get goosebumps) at least about 9 times. Before that I couldn&#39; t really remember the last time I cried. The book was really something special and the author is very talented. I was far more satisfied with the ending in the book that with the one in the movie. In the movie we are told that Jamie passes away. In the book, however, Jamie&#39; s fate depends on the readers&#39; interpretation and discretion (Nicholas Sparks also says this on his website). Landon concludes with &quot; . . . miracles can happen. &quot; <br/><br/>And so, my confession. . . I cried like hell after reading the book and for an adult male to do such a thing is unheard of and makes me a loser. But I don&#39; t really care, how could you not cry or be saddened with every page that Jamie grows weaker or every page that Landon feels more helpless? The way that the book is crafted make it so difficult not to get your emotions involved because you learn to love the characters and the fact that the story was told from Landon&#39; s point of view. <br/><br/>10 out of 10 stars - Fantastic book and movie",10
"I recently watched this movie over again on TV and I realized I didn&#39; t have it on DVD. So I rushed to the store and bought it. Here&#39; s what Hollywood may not know. <br/><br/>1. Relationships can be that pure and WITHOUT sex 2. Christians can actually be moral and non-hypocritical and follow their beliefs 3. Actors/actresses who weren&#39; t known as that before can actually give great performances. . . even if they were pop stars. . . <br/><br/>4. A Walk to Remember is a sweet, lovable, romantic story that can tear at your heart strings. I don&#39; t ever cry at movies. This one made me reach for tissues!",10
"This is one of the few movies that I can&#39; t get tired of watching it. It is absolutely amazing. The theme and story is just WOW! I was very happy when I first watched it, and I think I&#39; ve watched 20 or more times after that. Every time I watch it, I cry like a little baby. Plus Shane West and Mandy Moore play their characters extremely well! I just can&#39; t get enough of this movie. The whole begins with a stupid little joke that turns out bad which leaves Clay Gephardt (Matt Lutz) in the hospital, and popular kid Landon Rollins Carter (Shane West) in a whole lot of trouble at school. Landon is then forced to participate in different school activities which included the drama club. While in the drama club, Landon is forced to work with Jamie Elizabeth Sullivan (Mandy Moore) who is a very shy, quiet, and book smart girl at the school. Jamie is the daughter of Rev. Hegbert Sullivan (Peter Coyote); Landon and Jamie have known each other for a while but because of their social statuses at school they have been in different spaces. Landon seeks help from Jamie when he has trouble with his lines and that is when they started to get close. Jamie was resistant in the beginning but slowly started falling for Landon. On the other hand Landon tried to hide his relationship with Jamie from his &quot; popular&quot; friends but later on when his friends disrespected Jamie, he defended her in front of the whole school. As they grew closer to each other, Jamie reveals to Landon that she is suffering from Leukemia and that she had stopped responding to the medication. Landon is upset at first but later on changes his mind, and decided to help Jamie fulfill her wish list (this is when the movie gets so good). After a while Landon and Jamie get married, and they live for a while before she passes away. Landon then goes back to see Jamie&#39; s dad, they have a little talk. Landon then leaves and is seen smiling at the sunset. The theme of this movie is love clearly. It is a very romantic movie and also sad. The theme was portrayed in a couple of scenes. The first one was when Landon defended Jamie in front of the whole school, which just showed that his love for her was strong that he was willing to confront his friends for her. The second was when he built her kaleidoscope just so she can fulfill her wish of watching a comet (extremely beautiful). This movie can be compared to the Notebook in my opinion. I personally haven&#39; t watched the movie but from what I&#39; ve heard it seems like they are very similar. Lightning technique in this movie was used very well. Every time Landon and Jamie were having a beautiful moment, the light would be very bright, warm and actually peaceful. However during the rough times it would be a little bit gloomy just to match the mood. ",10
"I do not usually watch movies of the category Love-Romance, its just because i feel like adding some more boredom to a routine life full of responsibilities. So I used to kind of hate them as if they are real piece of torture until I happened to watch this movie. <br/><br/>After watching this, I realized what I have missed during my whole life till now. A Walk To Remember is a story about a guy who unexpectedly falls in Love with a girl who is going to die during her teenage bcoz of a disease. He realises this fact at the very second he proposes to her. <br/><br/>To talk about this movie, especially abt the character Jamie Salluvian. . I can just tell u one liner that I FALL IN LOVE WITH HER. She is the real human being, so calm pious religious helping so tender and what not, she is a kind of girl with whom everybody wants to talk with, wants to spend time with. By the word everybody, I mean to say not just guyz, but all kinds of people. Each and every scene in which if i see Jamie, she made me cry. That was the first time i literally cried while watching a movie. <br/><br/>It has left an undelible impression on me which, i cud not able to get over for 2 or 3 months. <br/><br/>Guyz, I don&#39; t know whether u believe it or not, its not at all exaggerating to say that I am completely changed after watching this movie. I really came to know what exactly LOVE means. This movie has taught me the real meaning of LOVE - A love for a life time. <br/><br/>I am spellbound with this movie in every aspect. This has become my most favourite movie for my life time. I bet no other movie can replace it for 100% sure. ",10
"When I first heard of this film, and because of when it was released, I automatically thought: &#39; It&#39; s just another one of those lovey dovey movies&#39; . . How wrong could I be. . This shows Jamie, who anyone can relate to, as the lonely girl who doesn&#39; t have any friends. . The amazing part is, she doesn&#39; t care. She wears what she wants, thinks what she wants, does what she wants, and even though everybody teases her, she carries on like nothing happened. Landon, at first, I thought was a right jerk. In all honesty I didn&#39; t have much hope for the movie in the first few scenes, as I thought she would fall for the jock/jerk and that would be the movie. Again, I was wrong. When Jamie reveals her Leukaemia to Landon, his reaction sealed the deal for me. The way he went to his dad for help, who then helped him, tried to make all her dreams come true, married her in her mother&#39; s church, built the telescope, and stayed by her side morning and night. The thing that scares me about death, is not death, but what happens after. The fact that one day, no one will remember who you are, or people will get over your death. That scares me. This movie made me feel as if there are people who are caring and kind enough to actually remember and still miss that person, four years later. I don&#39; t know if anyone will actually read this review, but I don&#39; t really care, as because of this movie, I have come to think that I will become more confident, and I believe it really has affected me as a person. I highly recommend this movie, to anyone who has ever loved, will ever love, has experience or witnessed death, is a hopeless romantic, or is even just looking for 100 minutes to kill. I guarantee you it will change your life in ways you didn&#39; t expect. All I can say now is. . I feel sorry for my future husband; He has a lot to live up to. ",10
"&quot; A walk to remember&quot; is a drama set in North Carolina. It&#39; s is written and produced by Adam Shankman and Karen Janszen. <br/><br/>The story begins in a school. The popular boy, Landon Carter and his friends are very stupid and they think they are the best in the world. London lacks faith in himself, in the wonder of life and in God. On the other hand, he has an intelligent and religious woman at school. Her name is Jamie Sullivan. She&#39; s a reverend&#39; s daughter. She wears baggy clothes and walks alone. <br/><br/>Landon partially responsible for a crime and he is punished for it. His punishment is to participate in the school theater and help sick children. Jamie does the same things for years. Landon starts to talk to Jamie and they fall in love. <br/><br/>Jamie helps Landon to redeem his faith in God. They do many things and live a beautiful love story. The movie reaches a dramatic climax when Jamie reveals her secret to London. <br/><br/>The cast (Mandy Moore and Shane West) is excellent. Mandy Moore is a certifiable superstar and Shane West is really good. This film brings innocence, sweetness, optimism and faith in life and love and the ability of every single person for change and the obligation to become better. <br/><br/>I would recommend it because this film is a life lesson. This film will make you cry and laugh and there is such a great message. Trust me!<br/><br/>by: Carolina Carvalho Simões de Oliveira Motta",10
"I picked this movie as a usual Friday night movie and I didn&#39; t expect that I was gonna cry at all. But to be honest, I cried so hard. and let me warn you, this movie MADE YOU CRY OUT YOUR EYES. <br/><br/>If I&#39; d describe this movie in a word, that would be &quot; Pure&quot; . The love between Jamie and Landon was so sweet and pure, and all the beautiful scenery used in this film made their relationship look more pure and lovable. Their pure love reminded me of my young love in high school and made me realize how the relationships I&#39; m getting into lately is messed up and not that pure anymore. <br/><br/>BTW, Some people might think these kind of movie is cheesy or too romantic, and I agree with those opinion, this movie could be cheesy and &quot; try to make audience cry too hard&quot; kind of movie, but still, considering those aspects of this movie, I&#39; m telling you this film is absolutely worth to watch. <br/><br/>Great scenery, great music, great cast, and great storyline. What else do you need? just watch it!!",9
"A Walk to Remember is a 2002 romance film based on the novel with the same name by Nicholas Sparks. The movie stars pop singer Mandy Moore, who plays Jamie Sullivan- the only daughter of the minister, and Shane West - one of the popular guys in the school (Landon Carter) . The movie was directed by Adam Shankman and has many nominations and wins. <br/><br/>The story begins when Landon nearly kills a fellow student when he and his friends play a prank on him. As punishment, Landon has to participate in after-school community service activities - help the staff in school, tutor kids and take part in the school&#39; s yearly play. This faces him with Jamie - a girl who he has known all his life but ignored. He gets to know her better as she helps him with the school play. Unexpectedly, Landon finds himself falling in love and this new friendship brings him many problems with his old friends, while Jamie is forced to deal with her strict father and a secret that she&#39; s keeping from her schoolmates. <br/><br/>The script is very exciting and the movie ends very dramatically. The actors are great professionals and their acting in the film proves that. The soundtracks of the film are so influential and the main song - &quot; Only hope&quot; by Mandy Moore is a really catchy tune. The movie is full of memorable moments and thoughts like: &quot; Find out who you are and do it on purpose. &quot; or &quot; Love is like the wind. You can&#39; t see it but you can feel it. &quot; Story like this was played before, but this movie does it much better than most. <br/><br/>Those who love teen romances will enjoy this film but not only they - this film will please a much wider audience, including adults and also men.

"I have to admit that I approached this movie with a sense of expectation and dread. Louis de Berniere&#39; s bestselling novel is one of my favourites and anyone who has read it will realise that there is no way in hell that any screen adaptation can be 100% faithful. <br/><br/>All the way through I found myself convincing myself that the movie was unsuccessful, and had stripped the book&#39; s plot back so far as to render it redundant. The ending, however, is much better than that in the novel, and I could not stop thinking about the movie afterwards. Still, the plusses (John Toll&#39; s magnificent cinematography, Stephen Warbeck&#39; s great score, etc) I felt did not outweigh my initial negatives (Cage&#39; s miscasting, a heavily diluted script). <br/><br/>But, two days later, I was queuing again to see Corelli, and although not perfect, I have to admit now that the movie is the best anyone could have expected. Cage is actually brilliant in a role that even de Berniere was concerned was not a fully rounded character: his carefree spirit which gives way to shattered remorse is spot on, and complements the superb double act of Penelope Cruz and John Hurt perfectly. David Morrissey is quietly effective as Weber, the Nazi officer trying to reconcile his feelings for his newfound Italian friends and his inbred superiority complex to those around him. And the fine Greco-Italian supporting cast bring de Berniere&#39; s sundrenched world of Cepholonia dazzlingly alive. <br/><br/>On leaving the cinema second time around, I finally let go my passion for the novel which prevented me from fully appreciating the story of WW2 Cepholonia in cinematic terms. My hat goes off to John Madden who, despite the almost expected critical drubbing he is receiving from the British critics (any director who has had a major success like Shakespeare in Love behind them is always a target for these moaning ninnies!), has managed to transfer a terrifically difficult book to the big screen with such heart, verve and humanity (the core virtues of the novel, in fact) that he has created another classic love story that will probably only be fully appreciated when the dust has settled a few years from now. <br/><br/>If you are a fan of the book, like me, it&#39; s hard, but try not to make the same mistake on your initial viewing. Try to erase the book from your mind for two hours, bathe yourself in the glorious Mediterranean atmosphere, and discover Corelli, Pelagia, Mandras, Dr Iannis, as if for the first time (pretend you&#39; re watching something made from an original screenplay), and I guarantee you won&#39; t be disappointed. <br/><br/>In fact, you&#39; ll be eagerly waiting to own your own copy of this delightful movie on video or DVD. <br/><br/>8/10",8
"As is often the case when you attempt to take a 400 plus page book and cram it into a two hour film, a lot is lost.  Here director John Madden (Shakespeare in Love) takes on an extremely ambitious project and almost pulls it off.  What we get is a charming and emotionally compelling film that seems somehow incomplete. <br/><br/>There is much about this film that is wonderful and fantastic.  The cinematography by John Toll (Cinematographer for Braveheart and Legends of the Fall, winning Oscars for both) is splendid.  Working with Madden, the choices for locations on the Greek island of Kefallonia are superb and the visual images that come from photographing these majestic locations in varying light are lush and beautiful.  Madden also uses numerous Greek actors as the townspeople, giving the town an authentic feel.  The soundtrack is also terrific and the mandolin passages and vocals by the Italian soldiers are marvelous. <br/><br/>Madden does an excellent job of bringing us the Italian occupation and the romance, which take up the greater part of the film.  There are numerous sweet and funny moments throughout this segment.  However, by the time the serious battle drama is ready to unfold, there isn&#39; t much film left in the reel and this component is extremely rushed and abbreviated.  While the battle scenes are well done, subsequent to the battle it is obvious that increasingly greater compromises are being made to keep the film from running too long. By the time we reach the post war scenes, the treatment is merely skeletal.  Another negative is that the DVD is particularly sparse on features. <br/><br/>Nicholas Cage is charming in the romantic lead as the sentimental Captain who seems to have joined the army to sing rather than fight.  When fight he must, Cage switches gears seamlessly into a man of fierce principle and resolve and somehow remains believable in both personas. <br/><br/>Penelope Cruz, whom the camera loves, gives an uninspired performance as Pelagia.  In part this is because Cage so dominates the screen, but Cruz just seems too placid in a part that should be emotionally torrential and dynamic.  She allows the character to be objectified as Corelli&#39; s love interest rather than establishing her as a powerful character in her own right. <br/><br/>John Hurt gives a fantastic performance as the wise old doctor, who knows as much about human nature as medicine.  However, Christian Bale seems a bit overwrought and stiff as Pelagia&#39; s fiancé. <br/><br/>I rated this film an 8/10.    Despite some drawbacks, this is a touching film that is well worth seeing.  The photography alone is worth the price of admission. ",8
"After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. <br/><br/>The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight. After German intervention, Greece is conquered and the island Pelagia lives on comes under Italian occupation, during which Pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage. ) This, of course, was a dilemma that came to many young women in occupied lands. As they got to know their occupiers, they started to see them not as the enemy but as real people, and sometimes fell in love - often to the disapproval of their neighbours. I just finished reading an interesting book about the German occupation of Britain&#39; s Channel Islands in which this was a major issue. Once Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them. <br/><br/>The second background issue is the Italian occupation itself, which I thought was quite realistically portrayed. First was the contempt with which the island treated their Italian occupiers. Greece defeated Italy (quite true from a historical perspective) and was really conquered by the Germans. The refusal of the town to surrender to the Italians and instead to insist on surrendering to a German officer struck me as something that could well have happened (and was quite funny in fact. I loved the line, &quot; we would rather surrender to this German&#39; s dog than to you Italians. &quot; ) The portrayal of the Italian troops also struck me as believable. The Italian Army was never enamoured of their German ally, and never enthusiastic about fighting with them. Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends, their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt. Here, the Italians are more interested in singing than fighting (which the German troops on the island simply can&#39; t understand, ) and are ecstatic when Italy makes peace and withdraws from the war - until they discover that this may well make them prisoners of the Germans. It was all quite well done, I thought. <br/><br/>It falters a bit at the end with an all too predictable finish, but still deserves praise. <br/><br/>7/10",7
"Being Of Cephallonian descent, I was happily surprised when watching the movie. I have heard the true history from my relatives that still live in Cephalonia, but when watching the movie and reading the book the sketchy bits of history were filled. It is all true, the Italians would sing, the oppression and the earthquakes that rock the island so often. The earthquake in 1953 killed my great grandfather and the book and movie both portray the feeling of the era with great compassion. If you haven&#39; t seen the movie go and watch it and read the book, it is not only a love story, and yes, there were plenty of Italians in love with Cephallonian women, in fact, boat loads of Cephallonian women were taken to Italy after the war, it is a true depiction of history. ",10
"Unlike many, I have not read the book and so I watched this purely as a film in its own right.  I&#39; m not especially keen on romance dramas, and I expected this to be a bit slushy and/or operatic so I was rather hesitant about going to see it in the first place. . . <br/><br/>But I&#39; m glad I did, because it was good.  Beautiful, &quot; feel good&quot; scenery and with a light touch of humour that made it rather more endearing than a straight drama would have been.  The romance was gentle, inoffensive and sufficiently interwoven with enough &quot; proper&quot; story-telling to keep my interest, and the score was not too obtrusively operatic. <br/><br/>
Overall, the film takes a satisfying circular route from start to finish, inducing a range of emotions as it progresses.  It&#39; s about 2 hours long, but I didn&#39; t find myself fidgeting or looking at my watch once - and that&#39; s quite a feat for me!!  Very enjoyable. ",6
"At first I didn&#39; t think I would like this movie, but as it progressed it became better and better.  I love music and I was impressed with how well Cage could fake the movements of playing a mandolin.  My son was with me and he also like the movie a lot for its music and the story and the way the story unfolded--- slowly showing how Corelli won the girls heart.  The acting and the story were both well done and well directed. At first Corelli&#39; s bravado was irritating, but soon he grew on you. The twists in the plot were intriguing especially the relations with the Germans.  I would like to see this again to follow all the side plots. I also want to buy the sound track to hear the music again. ",8
"When I was watching this movie one thought had come to my mind for several times: &quot; It&#39; s not really what I expected, I thought it would be better&quot; , but now that I finished watching it I realize: why should I expect a better result from this movie? Isn&#39; t it just a &quot; love story&quot; made up in Hollywood show&#39; s standards? Of course, it is! If so, why expect more? <br/><br/>Captain Corelli&#39; s mandolin is a romance story in war time (WWII) and the plot which I was noticed about before watch the movie seemed very interesting to me. All that I didn&#39; t count was the &quot; Hollywood standard&#39; s&quot; touch. . . What I mean by this is that I expected a story a bit more realistic and with a stronger plot (which was not full of &quot; plot holes&quot; as this one is!) instead of this &quot; sweet story romance, with the perfect ending&quot; , which we&#39; re used to watch in a great part of Hollywood&#39; s movies! Another Hollywood standard&#39; s gaffe which is very common is the natives&#39; languages issue. The differences between Italian, Greek and German languages were all done just by a stupid accent, and all people seem to understand each other very well. The Italian and the German army arrive to a &quot; forgotten&quot; Greek island and they all understand each other very well as they all speak the same language! Of course it&#39; s just little technical details that don&#39; t even matter to the plot, but are all this little details which separate a good from a bad production! <br/><br/>But the movie has not just bad-sided arguments! On the good side, I can find the original idea (which comes from a book), and the thought that is possible to be Human, and have Human feelings, even inside a War. It&#39; s possible to sing and be happy, have good feelings, to love and to be loved in a War time! Was because of that main idea that I wanted to watch this movie, and at this particular point I wasn&#39; t disappointed! I just was dissatisfied about the way it was made! Another good-sided argument is History&#39; s knowledge The movie is not very deep at that issue, but it&#39; s good enough to have a little idea how was the WWII in the Eastern-South Europe. <br/><br/>Globally Captain Corelli&#39; s mandolin is not a bad movie but it&#39; s not as good as I initially though either, mostly because of the &quot; Hollywood show&#39; s standards&quot; up-mentioned. ",6
"A beautiful, sensitive film that brings home the futility and cruelty of wars no matter what the so-called reasons. The performance of Cage and Cruz were quite impressive, but it is to the older Greek characters that go the highest praises. Irene Papas is as gorgeous as ever! Though some scenes seems a little long at times, this film will be a heavy Oscar contender. ",10
"&quot; Captain Corelli&#39; s Mandolin&quot; confuses more often than entertains. Although I haven&#39; t read Louis de Bernieres&#39; s World War II-era bestseller, I know enough about the changes to recognize the shortcomings of director John Madden&#39; s leaden movie adaptation. Audiences may remember this English director best for his 1999 Oscar-winning comedy &quot; Shakespeare in Love. &quot; Personally, I enjoyed Madden&#39; s earlier effort &quot; Mrs. Brown&quot; (1997), starring Judi Dench as Queen Victoria. Nevertheless, if good looks guaranteed great cinema, &quot; Captain Corelli&#39; s Mandolin&quot; would qualify as spectacular. Lensed on location in scenic Greece by two-time Oscar-winning cinematographer John (&quot; Braveheart&quot; ) Toll, this ambitious but abominable Nicholas Cage &amp; Penelope Cruz wartime tearjerker is easier on the eyes than the ears. Aside from establishing a concrete sense of setting and atmosphere, Madden and scenarist Shawn (&quot; A World Apart&quot; ) Slovo have butchered Bernieres&#39; s novel so that it emerges in bites and incomprehensible pieces. Incredibly, Madden and Slovo let the action veer erratically between comedy and tragedy with an indifferent romance at the heart handicapped by a curious lack of chemistry. Complaints about miscasting may arise in the minds of some moviegoers. Nicholas Cage&#39; s insufferably sweet, Puccini-loving, mandolin-strumming Italian artillery captain is almost enough to give Fascism a good name. Meanwhile, nothing good comes of Cage&#39; s ersatz Chico Marx accent. Actually, Sylvester Stallone would have been convincing in this role. If poor dialects irritate you, prepare for a veritable cacophony. English supporting actor John Hurt, Iberian beauty Penelope Cruz, and Welsh leading man/villain Christian Bale all sound and look out-of-place alongside Greek native Irene Papas. Purists will most likely skip this Zorba the Greek meets &quot; The English Patient, &quot; not only for its inconsistent babble of accents but also for its mishmash of historical revisionism, not to mention its pallid plot. <br/><br/>&quot; Captain Corelli&#39; s Mandolin&quot; unfolds on the idyllic Greek isle of Cephallonia in 1940. A wise old local physician, Dr. Iannis (John Hurt of &quot; Alien&quot; ), who has been compiling a history of the island and its earthquakes, narrates this yarn. He lives outside the village with his grown-up, headstrong daughter Pelagia (Penelope Cruz of &quot; Blow&quot; ) in a small mountainside home. A brawny fisherman called Mandras (Christian Bale of &quot; Shaft&quot; ) wins Pelagia&#39; s heart with his rough and tough ways. Her crusty old mustached father warns her from the start: &quot; I would expect you to marry a foreigner. &quot; According to him, Greek men dominate their wives, and Mandras is &quot; not her equal. &quot; When Mussolini invades Albania, Mandras and she get engaged. He ships out to fight the Italians. Pelagia pens dozens of letters, but Mandras never sends a reply. Later, we learn about Mandras&#39; s illiteracy. Perhaps Pelagia&#39; s father knows best. Anyway, this revelation smells like a plot contrivance. How could a bright, well-educated girl like Pelagia overlook such an obvious fact? She serves as her father&#39; s nurse and aspires to be a doctor herself. Doctors are trained to observe, so Pelagia should have known. Furthermore, neither Mandras nor Pelagia appear as if they were made for each other. One flirtatious splash in the Mediterranean doesn&#39; t a romance make. Madden doesn&#39; t pump up the passion between these two. Sadly, Bale and Cruz make an unpersuasive couple. Meanwhile, Madden has given audiences the village tour and introduced its citizenry. Dr. Iannis wields a fishhook to extract a dried pea from a man&#39; s ear canal. Although his hearing has been restored miraculously, the husband dreads a future where he must endure his wife&#39; s constant complaints. This joke serves as a bookend of sorts that opens and concludes the film. Suddenly, the skies erupt with military aircraft and parachutes blossom. Mussolini&#39; s Fascist troops have come to occupy Cephallonia and ships pour in more men and equipment. <br/><br/>When Captain Antonio Corelli (Nicholas Cage of &quot; The Family Man&quot; ) lays eyes on Pelagia, her beauty overwhelms him. &quot; Bella bambina!&quot; He exclaims and orders his platoon to glance in her direction. Initially, true to the romance formula, Pelagia wants nothing to do with Corelli. She regards the Italians with fear and loathing. Corelli is not only an artillery captain but also serves as a translator. The scene in the town square when the Greeks refuse to surrender to the Italians, preferring instead the Nazis, deserves a lusty laugh. Later, the Italians decide to billet their officer elsewhere. The Italian Army quartermaster makes arrangements with Dr. Iannis to board Corelli. Pelagia hates these arrangements, until the captain captivates her with his mandolin. <br/><br/>Gradually, Pelagia&#39; s glacial attitude melts, and she falls in love with Corelli, even after her betrothed returns to the island and joins the Greek partisans. Mandras&#39; s mother Drosoula (Irene Papas of TV&#39; s &quot; Homer&#39; s Odyssey&quot; ) is not happy about this new arrangement. The Cage &amp; Cruz romance kindles few sparks. A more meaningful but tragic romance occurs between a so-called good Nazi officer, Captain Gunter Weber (David Morrissey of &quot; Hilary and Jackie&quot; ) and another island girl. Although Madden shows the Italians firing their artillery, this bunch of guys heads to the beach to guzzle wine and warble Verdi operas to their prostitutes. At first, everything seems great when our protagonists learn that Mussolini has surrendered and the war is over for them. &quot; Captain Corelli&#39; s Mandolin&quot; has focused primarily on comedy until the Nazis come goose stomping into the action, and everything turns tragic. <br/><br/>Sadly, Madden botches both assignments. He cannot stage a decent big battlefield scene, and he fares no better with the intimate romance scenes. If you&#39; re looking for a better version of &quot; Captain Corelli&#39; s Mandolin, &quot; then check out Gabriele Salvatores&#39; s &quot; Mediterraneo&quot; (1991) which won the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. World War II buffs will appreciate the genuine-looking Stuka dive-bombers that rain destruction on Cephallonia. The lack of romantic chemistry, a hopelessly muddled plot, and leaden direction sabotages &quot; Captain Corelli&#39; s Mandolin, &quot; and it fade outs on a whimper rather than a bang of jubilation.

"(Spoilers throughout) Am I alone in thinking this film in many ways improves upon an excellent, if flawed, novel? Make no mistake: DeBernieres&#39; book is a modern classic, but it has two major weaknesses  one aesthetic, another of historical accuracy. This film nobly addresses both of these. <br/><br/>1) Captain Corelli&#39; s Mandolin is an excellent and moving novel. The idyllic pre-war life of the natives is vividly and touchingly depicted. The subsequent horrors of war are thus all the more harrowing when they finally arrive. <br/><br/>For all that, DeBernieres singularly fails to create a satisfactory conclusion. The last hundred pages or so detailing the intricacies of Pelagia&#39; s post-war existence are not uninteresting in themselves but seem banal indeed compared to the stirring drama that has come before. It is essentially a Second World War novel and should have ended with Corelli&#39; s departure from the island, or at least, soon after. The concluding chapters add nothing to the novel  DeBernieres should have been more ruthless and ended the story as soon as the main action stopped. The Great Escape would not have been improved by a concluding section about the surviving character&#39; s lives in the post-war decades and nor is this. <br/><br/>Commendably, the film improves upon this weakness. Now Corelli returns, soon after the war&#39; s end. This is a decided improvement on the novel where an ageing Corelli does not return  inexplicably  until fifty years later! It is thus far too late for him and Pelagia to get together and provides a wholly unsatisfactory outcome to the novel. <br/><br/>2) The novel is also undermined by a serious historical misrepresentation of the Greek anti-Nazi resistance movement, notably the organisation ELAS who Mandras falls in with. In the book, these are portrayed as Stalinist demagogues, more interested in the propagation of a narrow interpretation of Marxist dogma and political infighting with the British Allies, than genuinely resisting the Nazis. After the war, they are portrayed as practically being akin to the Nazi terror they supplant: <br/><br/>in Cephallonia the Communists began to deport awkward characters to concentration campsHitler would have been proud of such assiduous pupils. &#39; (p442). <br/><br/>As DeBernieres now grudgingly admits, in this respect, he got his research badly wrong. Although I am no expert on wartime Greece, by all accounts, ELAS played an active and constructive role in combating the Nazis. The film rectifies DeBernieres&#39; error, showing Mandras and the other guerrillas fighting the Nazis side by side with the Italians. This does involve a fairly major alteration in the novel&#39; s story line, however  Mandras&#39; s attempt at rape and subsequent death thus do not occur here, nor do any of his guerrilla experiences which are detailed throughout the middle stages of the book. <br/><br/>There were other changes in the film that I was less keen on, however. The role of the Italian soldier Carlo, who plays a fairly major part in the novel, is here almost wholly omitted, presumably because of fears that his homosexuality would offend the crucial American market. His gesture in saving Corelli from the firing squad is thus largely inexplicable, except as  rather lamely  a benevolent sacrifice towards Pelagia. <br/><br/>On the other hand, CCM is such a long and complex novel that one can forgive the film makers for not transcribing every aspect of the book to the screen. Film is a different medium to literature. The unfairly hostile critical reception this film has received suggests far too many expected a carbon copy of the novel to be revealed on film. (And as Madden also directed the generally awful but highly overrated Shakespeare in Love perhaps this evens the score somewhat). <br/><br/>That said, the film is not perfect. I am not convinced Cage was the ideal Captain Corelli. The depiction of village life does come across fairly whimsically and compares poorly to the portrayal of European rural life in the 1940s in Jean De Florette. Although I&#39; ve said changes from the book are not bad per se, some of the changes  the date of the earthquake from 1953 to 1947 seemed rather pointless. But generally ignore the pedants. The film would not be improved either by a) forcing the cast to learn and speak their character&#39; s native languages and subtitling throughout or b) correcting such &#39; inaccuracies&#39; as the Italians occupying the island for two years (er - they did) or b) depicting Abyssinian style atrocities committed by the Italian forces on the island (none recorded). While not quite in the class of other Second World War classics like Empire of the Sun, Schindler&#39; s List or The Bridge on the River Kwai, this is generally a good film. ",6
"A very poor acting and lack of identity characterises this film. Penelope Cruz avoids expressing any kind of feeling, even that of love and she keeps having that extremely serious look on her face. Nicolas Cage on the contrary expresses his feelings so intensely that he becomes unbelievable; it&#39; s like saying &quot; look, now I am a man who&#39; s happy for no apparent reason&quot; or &quot; now I am horrofied by Germans&#39; brutallity&quot; . However, Irene Pappas was unique as the Greek mother and John Hurt as Pelagia&#39; s father. I also enjoyed Emilios Chilakis in his very short appearance as the Greek guerilla: he talked in a very determined way as a man who has decided not to surrender should talk. However, even though the represantation of the specifique era was quite good, hardly as the actors try, they don&#39; t succeed in their roles of the locals (needless to say that Greeks actors are excluded). The pronunciation was a very big disadvantage: Pelagia spoke English with a Spanish pronunciation, Correli spoke English sometimes with bad italian accent, sometimes with perfect american accent; however he can also speak perfect German and he can read a text written in Greek!!! And the story goes on with that multi-language mess. Also, watching the film you can hardly believe that there is a war going on: It seems that Greece had no problems during the Occupation (by the Germans and the Italians), since Italian soldiers were here to enjoy the sun. Thank God that Germans arrive on the island and we start to remember that we are during a war. And yet, the director makes it appear as if Italians and Greeks were allies against the German enemy. People of Cephalonia fought really hard against Itallians and Germans and many of them were executed; but it seems as if Italians fought for the shake of Greeks while the later were enjoying the italian music. Besides, there was a very poor reprasantation of fight and bombing. And during that events, Pelagia found the time to fall in love with Corelli, before we could realise it: She seems more in love with Mandras than with Corelli and she has hardly exchange a complete and meaningful dialogue with him; however she can&#39; t live without him. The director actually does focus neither on war events nor on the love affair and that ruins the movie. Also, I can&#39; t avoid mentioning that I got tired of watching Pelagia walking around with a basket. I assure you that women had much more to do even in that time of &#39; 40&#39; s. <br/><br/>***SPOILER*** Can someone explain to me why the guerillas executed Eleni (Pelagia&#39; s friend) for simply kissing a German on the cheek and Mandras denies even his mother&#39; s request to save her, while Pelagia (who had a love affair with an Italian soldier and everybody Knows it) has their help and approval?<br/><br/>Finish studing Medicine in two years? That&#39; s a record!",4
"For one expecting to see action, action and more action, this is definitely NOT the movie to see. But for one dreaming of true life, with it&#39; s bad and it&#39; s good things, all wrapped up in a realistic cover, than it is sure you&#39; ve found the place, when going to Captain Corelli&#39; s Mandolin. Seeing almost all of this year&#39; s love movies (what came into our theaters) I can say this is second best after Moulin Rouge. The story is simpler but it&#39; s not a fairy tale. One could easily think this really happened, almost 65 years ago. I felt every moment of the Italian soldiers murder. . and I did regret as much the fact that the german captain did not commit suicide. It was the only thing honorable to do. But he didn&#39; t do it. . as it was war. . and no honor came before glory. Again a very good movie coming from the director of Shakespeare in love. He won a true fan. . . ",9
"My names Daniel and I&#39; m 15 years old. I go to the theaters at least once a week. Friday I saw Rat Race, which was just a fun movie to go to to laugh a few times. Then Sunday, today, I went to see Captain Corelli&#39; s Mandolin. It was fantastic. I have been waiting for an Oscar caliber movie to come out all year, and I think this qualifies.  My favorites of the year before this were Finding Forrester, AI, and The Others. They were all very good movies, but I think that this one was great. The music was awesome, the acting was great, the cinematography was beautiful. It was very well made. I loved it. Go see this movie, unless your the type that would find it boring, but it is a wonderful movie and I think it should win some Oscars. Go see it! I give this movie an A- or maybe even an A. John Hurt was awesome, and so was Cage and Cruz. Great movie! Best of the year. ",10
"The movie is set on a beautiful Greek Island. It is an adult love story taking place during WWII. <br/><br/>I found the beautiful island to be a joy to look at and the cinematography to be stunning. It looked like it was filmed in 3D with richness and depth. <br/><br/>The story is touching with good acting all around. I do think that the movie could have been expanded to develop the story more fully. <br/><br/>
The Greek people are warm and loving, the Italian soldiers are fun- loving and laid back and the Germans were as you&#39; d expect them to be except for the officer who accepts the surrender of the town&#39; s mayor who would rather surrender to the German&#39; s dog than to an Italian. <br/><br/>This is not a story for younger moviegoers but I believe that adults will enjoy it very much. ",10
"Brilliant film, put me through the whole range of emotions.  The setting was fabulous, the acting superb throughout.  The German officer was very good, what a character to play.  Nic Cage was fantastic as ever, perfect for this role.  It&#39; s got to be his best role since &quot; City of Angels&quot; .  Full marks to all involved. I loved this film completely, can&#39; t wait to get it on DVD and watch it over and over. ",10
"I actually was looking forward to this movie. After reading a number of reviews before the release, it sounded like a genuinely nice film, one that was beautifully filmed and one with an interesting cast (Nicholas Cage, Penelope Cruz and John Hurt. )<br/><br/>Well, it might have been all of those things BUT it is so boring that I defy almost anyone to sit through this in its entirety and keep attention. Also, Cage&#39; s attempt at speaking with an Italian accent is embarrassingly bad. He&#39; s such a good actor that I cringed every time he spoke in this film. <br/><br/>&#39; Disappointing&quot; seems to be the most-often word used by reviewers here to describe this film, and I totally agree. <br/><br/>I guess it didn&#39; t take long for word to get out about how bad this movie was because, like Cage&#39; s accent, it did not do well.

"SPOILERS AHEAD: Others here have wondered how this rates an IMDb 6/10. They&#39; re not alone, though my math runs slightly different: 8/10 for the first 30 minutes, zilch for the rest. Because it&#39; s as if there are two movies here: a lyrical small-budget essay about the impact of reluctant victors on reluctant losers. And a war movie so addled of execution you not only wonder where the hell the mandolin went, but where the plot disappeared to as well. It&#39; s as if director John Madden suddenly grows tired of the picturesque and picaresque and goes home, leaving everyone to stumble around in a morass of exploding cliches. Exposition? There ain&#39; t any. Bad enough that Cruz&#39; s capitulation to Cage is so unreal; worse, though, that the Italians sign up without demur or debate to the partisan side and battle it out with their former German allies for. . . What? No idea: if the island&#39; s some kind of strategic outpost, the script certainly seems unaware of it. Lazy film making doesn&#39; t get any lazier than this. What&#39; s especially sad about all this is that the original novel was based on fact, and wrought with such a delicate hand that it deservedly met with world-wide praise. Here, however, history is tarnished rather than garnished, and truth made to look like just another celluloid improbability. The nadir comes with the post-war &#39; earthquake&#39; , when you think &#39; aw for God&#39; s sake, do we REALLY need this rubbish on top of everything else?&#39; Only later do you realise that the earthquake did happen, and that it&#39; s the movie&#39; s narrative incompetence that makes fact look like fiction. Of the cast, only Cruz and Hurt are worth mentioning: Cruz, because she is a consistent, consummate actress, and Hurt because he gives the impression that there&#39; s still some dramatic meat left on the plate even when the script ultimately deprives him of anything to gnaw on. As a result, Hurt&#39; s concluding monologue -- which wraps up the entire movie -- at least sounds slightly less trite than as written, so that you&#39; re not completely flattened by the stupefying banality it all. Even so, the performances of Cruz and Hurt still fail to mask the central problem that, at the end of the day, &#39; Captain Correlli&#39; s Mandolin&#39; isn&#39; t actually about Corelli, or his mandolin, or indeed. . . anything at all. Hopeless. 2/10. ",1
"Not having read past the first chapter of the book I was happy to judge this film entirely on its own merits rather than comparing it with the well-known novel. Almost, anyway - the first chapter I remember was hilarious - yet the momentum is sadly lacking in the opening scene which dismisses the humour within seconds. World War II approaches and Germany and Mussolini invade Greece. Nicolas Cage, as the unconvincing Italian captain who is more attuned to singing than warfare, demonstrates quite admirably that this is the sort of film he should leave well alone. Penelope Cruz, as the Greek girl betrothed to another but who falls in love with Cage is slightly better, but not enough to lift this bland and syrupy film above mediocrity. The rest of acting is fairly wooden, most of the script quite predictable, and the moral ambiguities of fighting for the &#39; right&#39; side barely touched. The ending is unsatisfactory, as if we are expected to wait a couple of years and part with more money for part two. Part one didn&#39; t hold enough promise - the tedium and self-adoration in the photography and music failed to justify a film of over two hours that could have risen (but fell) on its own merits and lack of them, but it will most surely disappoint the many fans of what is reputedly an excellent novel.

"it is a lesson in butchering a book !<br/><br/>in turning a rich book into a soap opera film by removing all the substance of the story ! important characters have been cut , even the marten is not here !worse : the very personality of the main characters has been changed !<br/><br/>the casting is ridiculous ! with maybe the exception of john hurt and morrissey ( although his role is badly written) Nicholas Cage is totally ridiculous , too old for the part , too &quot; American&quot; and penelope cruz just cant act ! the directing is poor , even the costumes are wrong !<br/><br/>all the people who participated in this &quot; thing&quot; should be ashamed of themselves ! I have never been so furious in my life ! no need to say how much I have loved the book which i discovered last year only - it was not a big hit in France . So as a previous message puts it : read the book !!!",2
"I was totally put off by casting Nicholas Cage as Capt. Corelli, he was completely the wrong choice. Why don&#39; t the casting directors read the book and see how the characters are drawn? This is a soft gentle man, a musician whom Cage has no chance in a month of Sundays of being. First of all you need someone to look like the short pudgy character and Cage is anything but what Hollywood thinks will fill the seats! Oh and his accent was terrible!<br/><br/>At least the scenery was authentic and of course the romantic interest was cast well but whenever the movie makers try to make a popular book into a movie they rarely get it right because they think the book does not stand well enough on its own. They think the audience are dumb and don&#39; t think! Forget it enjoy the book. ",1
