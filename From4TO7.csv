When Harry Met Sally is a classic comedy. It&#39; s from a magical time when Billy Crystal could be a romantic lead and Meg Ryan was adorably not plastic. The dialogue is quick and witty and the characters are believable and likeable. Rob Reiner does a great job capturing the anxieties of friendship and romance. ,7
"Whenever I hear something about him, I wonder; what ever happened to Rob Reiner&#39; s career? What ever happen to that man that could direct any genre? The man who made us cry in &quot; Stand by me&quot; or made us scare to death in &quot; Misery&quot; is now out of the focus. I saw his last film, &quot; Alex &amp; Emma&quot; (which I tried to tolerate because of the actors who starred in it) and it was shameful to see he was promoting it with and advertisement saying: &quot; from the director of&quot; The director of &quot; When Harry met Sally&quot; , this movie, Reiner&#39; s most successful romantic comedy and film ever and by now probably a classic, because of Meg Ryan&#39; s famous scene and because of its general charm. Believe, everything is pink in this film, and the romantic story it proposes is something everyone has experienced. In some ways it reminded me to &quot; The mirror has to faces&quot; , but that couple relationship was totally different. <br/><br/>Here there are two guys in their 20&#39; s, travelling to New York for a better life, arguing about the things they think, do, and expect of their future, and so on. These scenes in the car driving to New York could be extremely boring, but writer Nora Ephron (who would write for Meg Ryan again in &quot; You&#39; ve got mail&quot; ) makes them very interesting. &quot; How can&#39; t you be afraid of death?&quot; , Sally tells Harry, and he answers: &quot; I&#39; m just prepared, when I read a book I always read the ending first in case I die and I can&#39; t finish it&quot; . <br/><br/>Years later that trip is history, and they both have various encounters through the years. She pretends he doesn&#39; t recognize her, because she remembers him perfectly. She was actually captivated by him on that trip but never told him. On the other hand, he pretends to be casual, but hasn&#39; t erased her from his mind; after more than a decade! Soon they start hanging out, telling each other everything, and become best friends; but if you saw them on the street you wouldn&#39; t doubt to think they are a couple. <br/><br/>Why don&#39; t they confess their feelings? You&#39; ve got to see the film to figure it out; you&#39; ve got to witness what happens, how it happens and most importantly why. In our original time, Rob Reiner did this picture more than a decade ago, and he directed it simply and honestly. Without knowing he also brought us one of the first climatic endings in a romantic comedy; those when the guy declares his love in the last minutes, in a powerful touching final speech, you know. <br/><br/>But what he actually got right was the cast. Yes, he got together two actors that achieved a unique chemistry in a movie that needed it entirely. Billy Crystal, showing that way of speaking that is only his and a mark for any good comedian. Rob Reiner helped him to become the super comedic star he was already becoming. And Meg Ryan will be ever grateful to this opportunity that showed her unusual beauty, natural talent and all the other things that would make her the queen of the romantic comedy. ",7
"&quot; She&#39; s out of My League&quot; is a solid 7, a romantic comedy that scores a few good laughs and does a nice job of being convincing. Jay Baruchel (Tropic Thunder) stars as Kirk, a pathetic dork with the build of Woody Allen who works a menial job in airport security. Through a cell-phone mishap, he winds up at a party being thrown by Molly (Alice Eve), a 10 on the very attractive scale. He knows she&#39; s way more attractive than him and she knows he&#39; s normally not the guy she would usually date but Molly looks deep down and sees Kirk for the nice, unthreatening guy he is and they hit it off. There are some funny moments here. Kirk&#39; s family is especially demeaning to him (they even embrace his bitchy ex-girlfriend as one of their own) and his friends are clueless match-makers, which leads to a very funny man-scaping scene between Kirk and one of them. What works best in &quot; League&quot; is just listening to people talk though. Kirk&#39; s friends (played by Mike Vogel, Nate Torrance, and T. J Miller) are identifiable idiots, too wrapped up in over-thinking things like the rating scale (both their number and womens) and Disney fairy-tales to really understand women. Their scenes with Kirk are enjoyably like a crude, vulgar, sexual &quot; Breakfast Club&quot; . The way the scrawny, nervous, and unconfident Baruchel interacts with the beautiful and engaging Eve is also very likable and they do a nice job of handling the ups and downs of forming an honest, meaningful relationship (an almost foreign concept in today&#39; s star-packaged romantic comedies). The way they finally handle the elephant in the room is also very effective. This is feel-good stuff, but it works. ",7
"Expectations weren&#39; t exactly through the roof for SOOML. No big name actors, a director with no feature film experience and a screenplay by the same guys who brought us Sex Drive. It is with great delight then, that what we get is 100 minutes of laughter and light-hearted entertainment. Is it clichéd? Sure is. We&#39; ve seen the &#39; underdog gets the girl&#39; story repetitively since the dawn of cinema, but at least scripters John Morris and Sean Anders inject it with humorous variations to ensure we forgive their shortcomings in originality. <br/><br/>Jay Baruchel was another unknown quantity. His supporting turns in Knocked Up, Fanboys, Tropic Thunder and Million Dollar Baby (remember the weakling who frequented the boxing hall despite his complete lack of talent – that was Baruchel) have provided laughs galore, but being the main star is different altogether. His geeky exterior and small frame isn&#39; t exactly leading man material however Baruchel&#39; s great comic timing and willingness to make a fool of himself if required makes him a likable headliner. <br/><br/>On the opposite end of the gender pole is the drop-dead gorgeous Alice Eve who, like Molly, is a hard ten. It&#39; s not just her looks that makes her popular with the men though, she&#39; s genuinely cool and doesn&#39; t have a whiff of ego. Elsewhere in the cast you&#39; ll find the previously unknown T. J. Miller as Kirk&#39; s best mate Stainer – a character who resembles Napoleon Dynamite if he were on crack cocaine – who delivers a handful of memorable one-liners and plenty of laugh-out-loud moments. <br/><br/>A charismatic cast and some hilarious jokes makes this a surprising winner. <br/><br/>3. 5 out of 5 (1 - Rubbish, 2 - Ordinary, 3 - Good, 4 - Excellent, 5 - Classic)",7
"(Synopsis) Molly (Alice Eve) is a sexy event planner who is delayed by a sleazy airport security guard. Another security guard, Kirk (Jay Baruchel) comes to her rescue, and passes her through to catch her plane. Luckily, Kirk finds Molly&#39; s phone that she left behind, and from the plane, Molly calls her phone and invites Kirk to a party to return her phone when she returns. Kirk is smitten by Molly, but his friends point out to him that he doesn&#39; t have a chance, because he is only rated as a &quot; 5&quot; and Molly is definitely a &quot; 10&quot; . And as everybody knows, you can only date a girl who is only &quot; 2&quot; above your score, so that means Kirk can only successfully date a &quot; 7&quot; . However, Molly has something else in mind, because she has found that Kirk is sweet, amusing, honest, and different from the men she has been dating. Kirk, on the other hand, has one big insecurity problem; Kirk believes Molly will dump him as soon as she realizes her mistake. Under these circumstances, and everything working against Kirk and Molly, is it possible for them to build a relationship that will bloom and flourish? <br/><br/>(My Comment) This is an unlikely love story that is a really sweet romantic comedy. You would think that it is a women&#39; s movie, but it actually is a guy&#39; s movie, because it gives the &quot; 5s&quot; of the world the belief that they have a chance to catch and have a relationship with a &quot; 10&quot; . The trailers portray that there are a lot of raunchy sex scenes in the movie, but actually, it is more your imagination then the real thing. The story does show and prove that a person with low self esteem will have a hard time in life fulfilling his dream. Hopefully, people who saw this movie will take this lesson of life to heart and go for the gold, or in this case a &quot; 10&quot; . Jay Baruchel&#39; s performance as the quirky geek was right on target, and Alice Eve&#39; s portrayal of Molly made her very likable. Both actors characterization of the low self-image problem was very believable. This is one of those hilariously funny love stories that could be a sleeper hit. I laughed throughout the whole movie, and left the movie in a happy mood. (Paramount, Run Time 1: 44, Rated R)(7/10)",7
"&quot; Do you even know how hot you are?&quot; <br/><br/>She&#39; s out of My League is a fairly typical comedy. Jay Baruchel plays an utterly average guy named Kirk, who is nothing more than mediocre in every aspect of his life, career, and looks. When a chance encounter leads to him meeting Molly (Alice Eve), a nearly- flawless woman (seriously, she&#39; s gorgeous in this movie) who seems interested in him despite all odds, Kirk has to deal with the new experience of being a 5 who&#39; s dating a hard 10. <br/><br/>So yeah, that&#39; s not exactly a fresh, new story. That can be forgiven in a comedy, as long as it&#39; s. . well, comedic. The movie manages to be pretty funny at times, but a lot of the humor is hit or miss. Something hilarious would happen, and then you&#39; ll spend the next five minutes wondering whether what you&#39; re seeing is supposed to be funny or not. Jay has been much funnier in other movies, and the supporting cast wavers between humorous and annoying. Still, the jokes in She&#39; s out of my League succeed more often than they fail. <br/><br/>The relationship between Kirk and Molly is a little hard to swallow at times, because she seems so determined to like him. Even though Kirk&#39; s personality in the movie isn&#39; t particularly remarkable. You actually start to believe their friends when they&#39; re constantly telling them that they&#39; re not going to work as a couple. The inevitable circumstances that cause problems for them seem extremely forced and predictable, as is their eventual reunion. There&#39; s little imagination involved in the story, that&#39; s for sure. <br/><br/>It probably seems like I didn&#39; t particularly like the movie, but I did. It was quite funny in parts, and even the most generic parts of it weren&#39; t bad - just overly familiar. This isn&#39; t a bad comedy to check out, I just wouldn&#39; t go so far as to recommend buying it. ",6
"In Pittsburgh, the clumsy and average Kirk (Jay Baruchel) works as a TSA security agent at the airport. Kirk is out of shape, uncoordinated, not college graduate, has never been in Europe and drives a shitbox Neon. His friends are a bunch of losers that also work at the airport and use to rank themselves and women. His family does not support him and his father used his college money to build a large swimming pool in the backyard of their house. Kirk dreams on becoming an airplane pilot, but he is insecure and without self-esteem. He also misses his former girlfriend Marnie (Lindsay Sloane), who is a bitch that humiliate him all the time. <br/><br/>One day, the gorgeous Molly McCleish (Alice Eve) is helped by him in the check-in to a flight to New York, but she forgets her iphone and Kirk holds it for her. On the next day, Molly invites Kirk to go to a party at the Andy Warhol Museum and he delivers her iphone to her. Sooner they date and he learns that she is a successful promoter of events that lives in a fancy apartment and drives a nice car. However, the lack of confidence of Kirk does not let him see that Molly loves him since she is totally out of his league. <br/><br/>The delightful &quot; She&#39; s Out of My League&quot; is one of the funniest comedies I have recently seen. Jay Baruchel is hilarious in the role of a man that has no self-esteem and self-confidence to be happy with one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen, Alice Eve, who is really a pretty woman. <br/><br/>Alice Eve was ranked #7 in 2010 in the &quot; Beautiful Famous Faces&quot; by &quot; The Annual Independent Critics List of the 100 Most Beautiful Famous Faces From Around the World. &quot; My vote is seven. <br/><br/>Title (Brazil): &quot; Ela é Demais para Mim&quot; (&quot; She is Out of My League&quot; )",7
"When I saw the trailer for She&#39; s Out of my League, I have to admit that I laughed, but I was thinking that if I had seen this movie, it would probably be a let down. One of those &quot; you saw the funny parts in the trailer&quot; movies. But still, I saw the movie just keeping my expectations low as most romantic comedies are just awful. Much to my pleasant surprise, She&#39; s Out of My League was a really funny movie that I enjoyed very much. In a society obsessed with looks and being perfect, most romantic comedies have these gorgeous people in the leads who don&#39; t look like they need any help in their love lives, we finally get a lead who isn&#39; t drop dead gorgeous as for Hollywood standards getting a beautiful person. Though I do wish we could have a romantic comedy with the opposite, not so hot girl gets the hot guy, I guess we&#39; ll have to wait a while for that. But She&#39; s Out of My League does deliver in the laughs and entertainment with great chemistry with our two leads and supporting cast. <br/><br/>Kirk is in his mid-20s who has a low self-esteem and, by his own admission, has not accomplished very much in life. He works at the Pittsburgh International Airport as a security officer and has very few goals other than trying to get back together with his self-centered ex-girlfriend Marnie. Marnie ended her relationship with Kirk two years ago and is highly dismissive of his continued romantic interests. However, she has remained close with Kirk&#39; s parents and overbearing brother and continues to participate in family activities along with her new boyfriend. With no relationship and an awkward family life, Kirk confides in his three close male friends who also work with him at the airport. Then at work one morning, a strikingly beautiful woman named Molly arrives at the passenger terminal for a flight to New York. She and Kirk exchange a few smiles and flirtatious words, and she then proceeds to her flight, accidentally leaving her iPhone in the airport security area. Upon realizing she has misplaced it, Molly calls her phone and Kirk, back at the security checkpoint, answers. To everyone&#39; s surprise Molly really likes Kirk, his friends constantly remind him he&#39; s a 5 and she&#39; s a 10, so he feels the pressure to keep her around. <br/><br/>What I liked most about this movie was how it wasn&#39; t a COMPLETE cliché, Molly&#39; s hot ex wants her back, but he doesn&#39; t go through outrageous attempts to get her back or anything, he&#39; s just as insecure as our leading male. It turns out that the only reason why Kirk is uncomfortable dating Molly is because he is reminded on a daily basis on how average he is and how he&#39; ll never get a gorgeous or sophisticated woman like Molly. A lot of people can relate to that, heck, how many times on the street do we see an unattractive looking person with someone who is really good looking and make a judgment? I loved how even his family were a bunch of jerks and not the typical &quot; we&#39; re rooting for our son&quot; mentality, they actually almost preferred his ex&#39; s new boyfriend over him, how sad is that? She&#39; s Out of My League is a big recommendation from me, definitely worth the rental when it comes out, it&#39; s one of the better romantic comedies that I&#39; ve seen. <br/><br/>7/10",7
"She&#39; s out of My League is the type of film that seems to suffer from a crisis of identity; is it a romantic comedy or an Apatow-esquire combination of raunch and insight? Jay Baruchel&#39; s first starring vehicle tries to have its cake and have sex with it too, and winds up splitting its resources to less effective result. <br/><br/>Frankly put, She&#39; s out of My League is not funny. There is the scattered chuckle and a few moments worthy of a laugh but for the most part the narrative just hums along; never becoming outwardly awful nor achieving anything memorable. The films saving grace is the chemistry between Jay Baruchel and Alice Eve which at times is so strong it almost makes the movie worth seeing in spite of itself. If SooML had concentrated on the romantic efforts, I feel like something excellent could have sprung forth, but with its scattershot approach we have only the leads on which to lean. <br/><br/>Perhaps the most refreshing thing about League is that Eve&#39; s Molly is actually a nice person. She is not manipulative, hot-but bitchy or using our nerdy hero for her own purposes. Usually in a movie like this we have the girl-best friend who unbeknownst to our swooning protagonist holds a flame, and after the hottie eventually betrays him, he finds love has been beside him all along, etc, etc. We don&#39; t have this here; there are now competing forces for Kirk&#39; s affections and the film and the audience win because of it. <br/><br/>There is a lame ongoing gag where our leads are rated; Kirk is a &#39; 5&#39; and whatever number you receive, the laws of nature inhibit you from deviating more than 2 &#39; points&#39; in either direction. Enter Molly, a hard &#39; 10&#39; and after leaving her cell phone at the airport where our geeky Romeo is employed she becomes somewhat smitten (feelings which he immediately returns) to the astonishment of his friends who can&#39; t believe his luck. From there we get our normal rom-com story arch which as I stated is heavily bolstered by amazing chemistry and performances from the star-crossed lovers. <br/><br/>Also like many movies of this ilk, the friends of the leads are jerks/bitches who more than once, accidentally or intentionally pull Kirk and Molly apart. I don&#39; t understand this resurfacing convention but it grows more distasteful with every film. Thankfully some of these characters undergo an epiphany so they do not remain totally repulsive characters. She&#39; s out of My League is unimposing and sweet, and is not above a watch on a date night or rainy Sunday but it certainly nothing to rush out to see in theatres. <br/><br/>Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies. blogspot. com",6
"I loved the book. I thought Julia Roberts as Liz was fantastic casting. The trailer looked awesome. I smiled every time I saw it. Turns out, I loved everything about this movie except the movie. <br/><br/>Long story short, it&#39; s all of the arc of the book, without any of the passion. While never horrible, this film simply made me feel nothing. <br/><br/>I found the book soulful, moving, even transformative at times. The greatest emotion I felt from the film was hunger (for Italian pizza), thirst (for Italian wine), and an occasional dizziness due to director Ryan Murphy&#39; s apparent recent discovery of how to &quot; pan. &quot; It was laughable camera-work throughout the first 45 minutes, and occasionally throughout. <br/><br/>The first 1/2 hour of the film was almost unbearably bad, even though the first section of the book was amongst my favorites. Perhaps someone who did not read the book could enjoy this movie, but I somehow doubt it. One time Liz made a joke, that was a nice break from the feeling of being in a lukewarm bathtub for 2 1/2 hours. Not unpleasant, just meh. <br/><br/>Instead of finding Liz intelligent and thoughtful, she seemed selfish, boring, and obsessed with men. Instead of finding spirituality, she seemed vapid. When the character becomes shallow, a film centered around that character becomes a throw away. Maybe I&#39; ll just watch the trailer again. ",4
"I love travelogues and I&#39; m a fan of Julia Roberts but, what happened here? I&#39; m not sure in what period, time wise, it this set. The only turmoil seems to be in this very selfish forty-something. What about the rest of the world? She goes for a sort of journey of discovery in a world that doesn&#39; t really exist. Did I miss something? No wars, no economic crisis, no nothing, only the intimate qualm of a woman who I, personally, cannot feel represented by. I grant you I&#39; m from another generation but, please! What is this. I loved the food and Javier Bardem and it is in fact the Bardem episode that brings some kind of recognizable something to the proceedings. So, let me recapitulate and ask you if we&#39; ve seen the same movie. . . A woman facing an existential crisis and moves out from her marital abode without even having a discussion about it with her husband - a scrumptious Billy Crudup - then she has an affair with James Franco - who wouldn&#39; t, right? - but the Franco in this movie is just a plain reflection of the Franco from &quot; Milk&quot; just to name one title. The Naples presented here seems out of the mind of someone who&#39; s never been to Naples. I don&#39; t know what to say. I&#39; m a bit puzzled and, I should confess, a bit annoyed. ",4
"When I read the book last year, I had just lost my job, was looking for a new one and eating everything that was bad for me, so I enjoyed Liz&#39; s misery and newfound joys. But now that I&#39; m content, in this new phase of life, I find myself annoyed by people who create their own drama and then whine about it. So I would not have enjoyed the book if I were to read it now. Although everyone does a good job in this film, and the scenery is breathtaking -- now I want to go to Rome!!!-- I really couldn&#39; t stand Liz. She has everything but whines about how &quot; I don&#39; t even know how to be HERE!&quot; I meet people in my new job who are fighting cancer every day -- they deserve the opportunity to whine (and few do, I might add). But pretty people who have everything and think they deserve more just tick me off. And it was a long painful sit. I do love the men in this movie -- each one of them is so good. And Julia Roberts does what she can with this selfish character. I just don&#39; t want to spend any more time with spoiled Liz. The time I spent watching her only ticked me off. I cannot recommend it, unless you&#39; re self centered, indulged and rich -- this could be your inspiration. Phoo!",4
"Two moments have stayed with me, one in particular: Javier Bardem crying as he says goodbye to his 19 year old son. The moment provokes a reaction on Julia Roberts&#39; s character that makes her totally human. The moment comes on the last third of the film so I thought it was a bit too late to start my relationship with her. The other moment happens at the beginning after she decides to walk away from her marriage and realizes she has broken her husband&#39; s heart. Terrific Billy Crudup fighting back tears as the elevator door closes. I love Julia Roberts but I can&#39; t quite buy her &quot; philosophical face&quot; 42 years of age in the new millennium is far too young for that kind of crisis, specially when the crisis is provoked by something missing in her. So, okay, a journey of discovery, but then. . . ? The discovery is that she knew it all along. What next. I must say the guys in the movie get the prize, third price really. The first price goes to the location, second price to the food - goodness, the food! - and third to the guys. Bardem fantastic, Richard Jenkins superb - Billy Crudup surprisingly real, James Franco also great and Luca Argentero another plus. ",7
"That was my interpretation of this weekend that I had to endure working at my movie theater, all these little hormone crazed brace wearing under developed young girls who I think would&#39; ve just about died with the anticipation of seeing Twilight, I&#39; m not kidding, I personally witnessed a twelve year old say that she wanted to have Robert Pattinson&#39; s baby. OK, so how I saw the movie, my sister, ironically my older sister has been just raving about the Twilight series with her friends and told me that I have to read these books, after weeks of bugging me with it, I finally broke down and read them. Actually it&#39; s kind of a fun series, it reminded me of the same love that I had for the TV series Buffy the vampire Slayer when I was a young teen. But of course she has to take me to the midnight premiere with 100, 000 crazed fans who were knocking each other down and crawling all over each other just to see a movie. <br/><br/>Bella Swan has always been a little bit different, never caring about fitting in with the trendy girls at her Phoenix high school. When her mother remarries and sends Bella to live with her father in the rainy little town of Forks, Washington, she doesn&#39; t expect much of anything to change. Then she meets the mysterious and beautiful Edward Cullen. Intelligent and witty, he sees straight into her soul. Soon, Bella and Edward are swept up in a passionate and decidedly unorthodox romance. Edward can run faster than a mountain lion, he can stop a moving car with his bare hands - and he hasn&#39; t aged since 1918. Like all vampires, he&#39; s immortal. But he doesn&#39; t have fangs, and he doesn&#39; t drink human blood. <br/><br/>So, my opinion about Twilight the movie. . . honestly, it&#39; s average, it&#39; s my junior high romance with a vampire. I hate, beyond hate to say this, I&#39; m a hypocrite for saying this, but because I read the book before I saw the movie, I had this completely different interpretation of what the characters look like and how they say certain lines. Twilight the movie made me laugh more than anything simply because of the actors, Robert and Kristen are not bad actors, but the way they talked, I just couldn&#39; t take their &quot; love&quot; seriously. Peter Facinelli who played Carlisle Cullen, Edward&#39; s father, was exactly how I pictured and pulled in the best performance of the film. Is it worth the watch, absolutely if you&#39; re a fan of the books, otherwise, I would say if you just wanna see this movie, I recommend the matinée price because honestly, I think I may have lost my hearing after this weekend of the none stop screams from crazed teens. <br/><br/>5/10",5
"NOTE: This review is the fair and unbiased opinion of someone with extremely little knowledge of the Twilight series. I watched the movie with a few die hard fans who I talked to after the movie, and I will work some of their thoughts into the review. <br/><br/>Another much loved book series has been brought to life in the form of Twilight, which despite having nothing in common with the Harry Potter series, will undoubtedly draw comparisons because of the furor and craze surrounding it. The main difference between the two, however, is that the Harry Potter films are generally good and solid films. Twilight, despite having done a couple things right, is not. <br/><br/>As a story, I will admit, Twilight is very catchy and interesting. Now I see what all the hype is about. If I was a young girl, I would go nuts over this stuff too. It&#39; s not just a vampire and a human falling in love with each other, but because of the two leads, it&#39; s one of the best on screen romances of the decade. This, however, is severely hurt by the fact that Twilight boasts easily some of the worst writing and editing I&#39; ve ever seen. Let&#39; s not forget about the horrid VFX and pasty makeup, either. It&#39; s one of the cheesiest films of the year, and can definitely be put in the category of &quot; so bad it&#39; s ALMOST good&quot; . Yes, I just invented that category. <br/><br/>The &#39; allure&#39; of the film appears to be the character played by Robert Pattinson, who ironically was previously known for his role in the Harry Potter series. Pattinson succeeded there and he more than succeeds again, as he more than fit the bill for what he needed to do with the character. Most actors would believe the only requirement of the character is to be good looking, but Pattinson takes it a step further and makes Edward Cullen very likable, trustworthy, and in the end, a good hero for the audience. Kristen Stewart is sort of the queen of not showing facial expressions, so she&#39; s perfect for the role of the awkward teen Bella Swann. However, there were sometimes where her lack of emotion bothered me. <br/><br/>Our supporting players. . . Well, none of them are noteworthy like Pattinson is. The villain of the film is lame, cheesy, and played by an actor I can&#39; t take seriously. Nikki Reed is probably the best as Rosalie, Edward&#39; s &#39; sister&#39; , and the antagonistic vibe felt from her adds a different side to the movie. <br/><br/>Okay, I don&#39; t really know what possessed the writer of this screenplay to make it so horrible (was it the source material?), because the dialog is just so bad that I laughed at serious moments. There&#39; s a lot of intentional humor, mostly in the beginning when Bella and Edward feel like awkward teens in love. I guess the movie moved along okay, because I wasn&#39; t bored at all. I was either laughing at how stupid the dialog was, laughing at some of the mildly funny jokes, or getting pulled in by the electric chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson. <br/><br/>That, folks, is the reason most people will be able to sit through this movie. The chemistry between the two leads, romantically and sexually, is amazing. In this respect, Pattinson and Stewart are perfectly cast and it makes me wonder if they could end up together in real life some day. I was very surprised by how much I liked seeing their one on one scenes, as cheesy and bad as the VFX and editing are. <br/><br/>As far as these visual effects go, I&#39; ve seen a few vampire movies in my day. I&#39; m going to assume director Catherine Hardwicke has seen a few. Well, she needs to watch a few more. Her fight scenes are horribly choreographed, terribly shot, and lack the intensity required to successfully rouse her audience. I could almost notice the wires the actors flew across on. I noticed a ton of errors with the editing as well, such as basic stuff like mouths moving and no words coming out, and words coming out when no mouths were moving. The fight scene at the end has wicked bad editing too, as the sound mixing also suffers as well. <br/><br/>All in all, with Twilight, as bad a movie as it may be, I couldn&#39; t help but stay interested in it because of the electric chemistry between the leads. That alone kept me in the seat the whole time. It is technically one of the worst films of the year, but the entertainment factor in the above respect keeps it out of the company of movies like Disaster Movie and College. I was actually lucky to see it with some of the fans of the book, and all of them (5) described the movie as a &#39; disappointment&#39; and that the film went &#39; half way&#39; with some subplots, either starting and dropping them, or randomly starting them halfway through an individual subplot. They were not happy at all with this movie, but agreed on one thing: Robert Pattinson was the perfect Edward Cullen. I&#39; ll agree with them on all those points and say that Twilight is exactly what I thought it would be: so bad it&#39; s ALMOST good. ",4
"This is just one person&#39; s opinion. No need to get angry, in fact I&#39; d like you to convince me I&#39; m wrong. <br/><br/>The movie is missing the magic. Edward appeared on screen and I swooned. He opened his mouth and I cringed. Edward is strong and confident. He wasn&#39; t a whiney, smitten child. In love yes, but brooding and in pain. Bella was delicate, not just dry and indifferent. This Bella lacked emotion maybe even a soul-who is she? She didn&#39; t feel like the yearning, thoughtful Bella I had imagined. I wished she needed to be protected. This version can take care of her own business--and I&#39; m not sure how bad she wants to be with Edward, or why for that matter. Maybe if she narrated her emotions would have been more pronounced. Don&#39; t get me wrong, the actors&#39; chemistry is very evident, they should get married and have melodramatic children. But was the film from Bella&#39; s perspective or not? The changing pov was off-putting. This film proves that Meyer&#39; s pages and pages are what bring this story and Edward and Bella&#39; s love to life. <br/><br/>The TONE was completely lost in the book to script to screen translation. The story is supposed to be a song that takes you to another world, one where vampires and werewolves exist. The story is an intoxicating melody. Here we&#39; re presented with a boy-band pop song sung by kids who think of themselves as classically trained Opera singers. PICK ONE. Be a chart-topping, America&#39; s Top 40 or be the haunting, dangerous lullaby I think a lot of fans were looking for. <br/><br/>Speaking of boy band. . . the screen version of Jacob Black is one &quot; Bye Bye Bye&quot; from being the lead singer in Over-Produced-Axe-Wearing-Guy-Group 2008. Jacob, in my mind, is earthy. He&#39; s a guy&#39; s guy and gets his hands dirty fixing cars and building stuff. Jacob always left me feeling like he was wise beyond his years, a smitten kitten of course, but I always felt that he was more dynamic than this cute little wig-wearing version. I always felt this sense of history and quiet power. This version wears Abercrombie (and randomly appears from behind trees apparently. . . you&#39; ll see). <br/><br/>The cast was quite OK for me. I did feel bad watching them try to deliver the lines they were given. I get that this is a vampire-romance movie, but honestly. The script is dripping in gooey, sticky, melted, mixed cheeses. OK, so it&#39; s fantastical, but to slap me in the face with Gouda and Brie every other frame is just insulting. <br/><br/>Cheese aside, Charlie was great. His timing was spot on. Carlisle played the part, but the caked-on white makeup so completely distracting. Esme-- I wanted to crawl up onto her lap and have her tell me bedtime stories. Love it. Alice. . . that&#39; s her on that screen. A little bouncier and she&#39; s perfect. Jasper-- freakishly creepy and pained, loved it. When he comes out of his shell and plays more than the wide-eyed silent sidekick, I&#39; m all over it. Those who doubted Reed need to reconsider. Rosalie is freaking hot and one sassy vamp. Emmett. . . holy crap, on the money (call me). Jessica is the best casting job in life. . . Mike, however. . . really?<br/><br/>I know that this is just a movie. Film is a different medium than books. We get to create the world from a book but people get to interpret for us on screen, I know. I just wish it wasn&#39; t so far off base for me. I wanted nothing more than to enjoy it. I think I&#39; m going to remember the series the way I imagined it and set this version aside. My oil canvas painting to their Polaroid. <br/><br/>Who&#39; s melodramatic now? This girl. <br/><br/>Here&#39; s hopping they make a choice for the next one: teen scene or dark love story so audiences know what they&#39; re getting into. Teenie Boppers are quite loyal, perhaps bubblegum will beef up their box office. ",5
"To preface this review, I read all four Twilight books in one weekend (last weekend, actually) when I picked the first one up at the airport, and could not put it down. I zipped through the other three and went to the midnight screening on opening day. To say the least, I was captivated by Twilight (and I&#39; m in my 20s. . . ). <br/><br/>I was anxious to see the movie because, like so many other people, I felt really invested in Bella and Edward&#39; s story. Not only that, but I love the vampire premise - it just never gets old, especially when you put a new spin on it, as Meyer did in her books. The events of each book really ran together for me, so in a way, I felt like a non-Twilighter coming into this film. I really didn&#39; t care if the movie deviated from the book - in fact, I was kind of hoping it would, since you can&#39; t expect a book to translate directly to the screen. I heard a lot of serious Twilight teens complaining about &quot; major things&quot; missing when I left the theater, but I honestly didn&#39; t notice any major omissions. <br/><br/>Overall, the film was better than I expected (based on previews, I expected it to be extremely cheesy, low-budget, and awkwardly filmed). It definitely grew on me as it went on, especially Pattinson&#39; s performance. His introduction was extremely awkward - not sure if that was Hardwicke&#39; s fault or Pattinson&#39; s acting. In any case, as soon as he settled into his character, he was absolutely captivating. Stewart plays a great brooder, and she certainly did that here. I loved the scenes with her father; in my opinion, these were some of the gems of the movie. <br/><br/>The romance between Edward and Bella, which was obviously the crux of the film, was fueled by their chemistry, but not much else. Where was the development?! I really wish Hardwicke or the screenwriter or somebody had taken more time to delve into the roots of their relationship. It all just happened way too fast. I feel like this happened because of the James story, which to me was almost completely unnecessary (yeah, I know, it&#39; s a big part of the book and obviously needs to be here). But even so, the film would have been a more moving romance, and probably a more poignant, emotional film, if that cheesy, goofy subplot hadn&#39; t existed. <br/><br/>Hardwicke dealt exceptionally well with teen angst, which was evident in the high school shots. Unfortunately, she really struggled with the vampire side of things. I have to put most of the blame on the director because the characters were all spot-on, very well-acted and well-cast. I also think a higher budget would have done wonders for this movie, and I&#39; m hoping that becomes a reality for the sequel. The special effects were embarrassingly bad, and nearly ruined the movie. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed &quot; Twilight&quot; for what it was - a romance that probed the timeless dilemma of wanting what you can&#39; t have (and despite Meyer&#39; s Mormon beliefs, this whole series is basically a metaphor for sex). It makes for an interesting, compelling story, and I expect more from the sequels, because the potential is certainly there. ",7
"After the enormous flurry of attention Stephanie Meyer&#39; s literary series attracted (a unique hybrid of Romeo and Juliet style teenage angst and hormonal lust and supernatural horror), a cinematic adaptation seemed not only inevitable but almost expected, providing sultry visuals to the tale of starstruck lovers and proving the definitive date movie for months to come. However, the curse of mainstream literary adaptations proves inescapable, with excitement surrounding the release leading to the film being somewhat unreasonably over-hyped. And while Twilight is hardly a complete failure of a film by any standards, there remains the inescapable sense of its existence being geared to match up to a set standard rather than simply aiming to succeed as a film, making for the overall result being uniformly disappointing, whether for fans of the source material or those unfamiliar with the novels. <br/><br/>Few Hollywood productions have the concern of appealing to both the demographics flocking to romances and supernatural action films, and as such, the impression is frequently given of Twilight biting off more than it can chew. This indecision between concentrating on the supernatural or romantic facets of the film leads to one of the more glaring flaws of the picture - the sense of neither being devoted enough focus to truly excel. While the climactic battle is gruesomely effective, for the most part, the film&#39; s special effects appear rushed, under-budgeted and just plain sloppy, coasting by on horrendously unconvincing slow motion to represent vampire super-speed and making moments which should have been filled with wonder and awe instead evoke unintentional laughs and groans. However, Meyer&#39; s revisionist take on vampire lore is intriguing, and the viewer wishes the film had delved into the technical aspects of immortal vampire lifestyles further - a sequence where protagonist Bella slowly begins to suspect the true identity of the mysterious boy she has found herself involved with is impressively eerie and chilling. Such moments are aided incalculably by the tremendous musical score of Carter Burwell, whose bold mix of brassy Gothic themes and eerie, chilling motifs perfectly compliments the intensity of the film. <br/><br/>However, Twilight&#39; s main concern lies in its script, which boasts some particularly gruesome patches of dialogue apart from the general lack of characterisation one has sadly grown to expect from the teen romance genre. Similarly, despite director Catherine Hardwicke appearing to be the perfect candidate to helm such a film (with directorial debut Thirteen demonstrating a keen knowledge of the teenage girl mentality), her handling of the source material is unfortunately shaky. The film repeatedly falls prey to the &quot; Harry Potter syndrome&quot; , feeling somewhat clunky in its almost robotic adherence to its source material, giving it the sense of jumping awkwardly from plot point to plot point and lacking the necessary cohesion and narrative flow. <br/><br/>But most importantly, for a film revolving around its central romantic attraction and sexual tension, the audience is never really given the chance to FEEL the romance, to be drawn in by the mutual lust and entrapment of the two leads for one another. In an oddly rushed sequence, the budding romance between protagonists Bella and Edward is reduced to a couple of nonchalant sessions of hanging out, mostly demonstrated through montage, after which Bella&#39; s (largely unnecessary) narration declares her unequivocal love for Edward. This rather abrupt transition would toe the line of appearing satirical of teenage romance were it not for the fact that the viewer realises the moment is meant to be completely heartfelt. What was likely far more effective in literary form, with the chance to understand Bella&#39; s emotions and mental process making the romance far more credible does not translate into film. As such, with this crucial central romance lacking the necessary spark which made the novel such a success, Twilight, for all of its periodic cinematic potential, just feels somewhat unnecessary. <br/><br/>The film&#39; s casting is perfectly passable, supplying a sufficient variety of up and coming pristine teenage beauties capable of essaying their character types, yet for a book which was driven by such genuine intensity and passion, one can&#39; t help thinking of all the performances as somewhat listless and flat. While Kristen Stewart makes a passable romantic lead as headstrong Bella, she lacks the necessary charismatic spark to truly make the viewer warm to her, making her teenaged-angst interludes harder to empathise with. Robert Pattinson does his best as teenage dreamboat vampire Edward, sharing strong chemistry with Stewart, even if his &quot; sultry, moody glances&quot; delve into the melodramatic to the point of verging on comical at times. The rest of the cast give rather bland but serviceable performances, the standouts being Cam Gigandet who is mercifully given the chance to gleefully chomp on scenery and generate sufficient menace as sadistic villainous vampire James and Ashley Greene who essays the ideal balance of being sweetly charming without being overly chirpy as Edward&#39; s kind-hearted sister Alice. However, despite his best efforts, Billy Burke is forced to wade through &quot; stern but absent father&quot; clichés to the point of being almost invisible as Bella&#39; s emotionally stunted parental figure, and Taylor Lautner fares little better as mysterious prospective love interest Jacob. <br/><br/>While Twilight is hardly a failure on all fronts, with a sporatic peppering of effective moments, the word which most ably describes the film as a whole is &#39; passable&#39; , lacking the necessary intensity or impact to truly hit home. It is easy to envision the adaptation being far more satisfying if done as a smaller, independent production outside the shadow of Hollywood, one which would not shy away from capturing the true passion and intensity of the central relationship without baulking at the prospect of a simmering yet sexless teenage relationship. As is, Hardwicke&#39; s film is content to succumb to cliché and sloppy, complacent storytelling, making it far too &#39; bloodless&#39; to truly satisfy. <br/><br/>-4/10",4
"I&#39; m an avid Twilight reader and stalker (yes I went to Hot Topic tour. ) I can&#39; t remember a time when I was SO anxious and excited to see a movie. I just saw Twilight at a screening in San Francisco on 11/17. I left the theatre feeling. . indifferent. <br/><br/>First of all, I knew the movie was not going to be based exactly to the books but at the same time it kind of hurts me to say that it just wasn&#39; t good. ~sigh I felt that the director Catherine tried to bring her indie elements into the Hollywood style movie that just didn&#39; t work. The opening scene with the deer was alright, but I was just about to laugh out loud when the movie got to Edward and Bella finally acknowledging what Edward truly was. This was the biggest issue I had. I didn&#39; t think viewers were able to experience the intensity of Bella and Edward relationship. I wouldn&#39; t believe that Bella was ready to place her undying pledge to go vamp at the end. The scene was so choppy, where it felt like the scene was full of greatest hits of one liners all cram into this one scene. It wasn&#39; t the turning point as where it should have been. The movie was clearly not based on romance, which is the ultimate theme of the book. The movie hastily breezed through the courtship development to finally get to the lingering action sequence. <br/><br/>I like Robert but he just couldn&#39; t pull off a convincing Edward. His reaction to Bella in Biology class was just laughable. Again Catherine trying to pull the artsy camera cuts--- silly, silly. Jasper&#39; s reaction was humorous also. <br/><br/>Edward&#39; s showing Bella who he was in the sun was not remarkable. His body hardly glisten. Couldn&#39; t they get Britney&#39; s Swarovski body suit from her &quot; Toxic&quot; video? The movie nicely brought out Rosalie&#39; s dislike for Bella. Alice was very convincing and good. Carlise was attractive and fitting. <br/><br/>I was surprised by the diverse student body of Forks. I liked Jessica a lot. It was hard to see her as the small minded character as how she was written in the book. <br/><br/>All in all, this movie wasn&#39; t made for fans of the book, but to lure moviegoers into (hopefully) the film franchise. <br/><br/>Little things that could have been included in the movie to make the readers happy wasn&#39; t included. Such as why couldn&#39; t Bella wear the blue V neck sweater when meeting the Cullens for the first time? Why couldn&#39; t Bella attack Edward on the onset of their first kiss? Why couldn&#39; t Edward&#39; s couch be black? Why did James bite Bella on her forearm and not her hand? <br/><br/>As a Twilighter, I think I may go see it again just to see if my reactions change, but I wouldn&#39; t recommend this film to any non-Twilighters.

"After his last holiday-themed box-office smash Valentine&#39; s Day in 2010, director Garry Marshall has carbon-copied the exact same formula for his latest film New Year&#39; s Eve which uses its gigantic ensemble cast to document various different relationships and states of emotions over the course of a single day and night in New York City. <br/><br/>The story lines include: a couple awaiting the birth of their child, two people who become trapped together in an elevator and a gentleman who is trying to enjoy his last New Year&#39; s Eve on earth as he sadly lays on his deathbed. <br/><br/>Much like Valentine&#39; s Day, Marshall&#39; s latest film seems to forget the importance of character development and indeed sure-footed narrative; these films feel like the audience are watching Ashton Kutcher flirt with Lea Michele, or Zac Efron helping Michelle Pfeiffer, which – in all honesty – they are. Never are viewers able to break away from the celebrities portraying these supposed characters, which cause great issues when trying to build and present emotion. <br/><br/>The film also has some bizarre cast members, including the incredibly pointless Jon Bon Jovi who slinks about, and may as well be promoting a new Greatest Hits album when he enters the frame. Stars like Halle Berry and Robert De Niro are incredibly redundant here, even though they do benefit from moderate screen-time. Performers like De Niro are worthy of a solid script and something more important to do rather than just stand around holding a theoretical sign saying &#39; And Robert De Niro&#39; . <br/><br/>Contrary to the opinion of the majority of critics (or males), &#39; Valentine&#39; s Day&#39; was yes fluffy, gooey and forgettable two hours, but also entertaining. It did try very slightly to be different – with a gay romance amongst other things – and whilst this was all still &quot; Hollywood&quot; , there were far worse movies released in 2010. <br/><br/>To be fair to &#39; New Year&#39; s Eve&#39; , it is not amongst the worst of the year. This might be due to the fact that most of the audience had or have extremely low expectations upon arrival. Expecting a film to be bad makes it all the less painful if the final product is indeed poor and consequently, makes it seem much better than it truly is if a viewer is not disappointed. <br/><br/>&#39; New Year&#39; s Eve&#39; felt mechanical and forced, a project merely designed for profit – there is no love nor compassion, no credibility nor realism. This is rather a 118 minute tourist video about how wonderful The Big Apple is, and how beautiful the people who reside in it are. Throw in disgusting amounts of product placement and an old rock star, and hey, you&#39; ve got a $100 million motion picture! Spend your £8 at the cinema this Christmas on a film that gives like &#39; Hugo&#39; rather than this, and save the holiday romances for &#39; Love Actually&#39; on DVD with the family or partner. <br/><br/>Verdict:  It is better if Marshall does not attempt to make another movie about a commercial holiday again. If we see a trailer with Kutcher dressed as the Easter Bunny for love next year, run for your life. <br/><br/>For more The Upcoming reviews http: //www. theupcoming. co. uk/category/culture/cinema/",4
"I don&#39; t think I understand people at all. I watched it despite all the bad reviews and I didn&#39; t regret it. I&#39; m starting to think people are really bitter, it&#39; s a really sweet movie about new years and how people feel around that time of the year, it actually gave me a warm feeling, so yes, it&#39; s not a deep smart full of effects movie, but sometimes people need a movie like this, I&#39; m all against unchallenging movies, but I don&#39; t think this was the case at all. It&#39; s the perfect new year movie, that gives you hope for the year to come and live everyday fully. The variety of characters is okay, as you get to know them enough to see a little bit of yourself in them or not, and it&#39; s really interesting to see what different people go through at that time of the year and how they feel and what they hope to change. It really is a warm, hopeful movie, at least that&#39; s the way I saw it. Sometimes we need to take a break and take a deep breath, that&#39; s the movie. ",7
"I rather enjoy the odd ensemble comedy such as this film, I somewhat enjoyed Valentines Day and I really enjoyed He&#39; s Just Not That Into You, but what those film had but this doesn&#39; t is a fewer amount of plot lines. There&#39; s just too much going on in this film, far too many characters, as soon as I found myself interested in one plot its segment would end, you can never get really attached to one set of characters. <br/><br/>For me the best storyline was the Michelle Pfieffer and Zefron plot, it was really the only one with a bit of substance, I actually think a full movie of that story would be great, also the Jessica Biel and Seth Meyers plot was rather funny thanks to the highly underrated Ms Biel. This movie is entertaining enough I suppose but it&#39; s also lacking any real great laugh out loud moments, the only time I laughed was when Jessica Biel was in labour, she could do some great comedy if given the chance. <br/><br/>Lea Michele manages to bring her great screen charisma to the big screen, she is very fun to watch and her rendition of Aude Lang Syne was lovely and a nice way to end the movie. <br/><br/>If this movie had about four or five less stories happening this movie would have been much better, it&#39; s not horrible by any standards but it&#39; s not excellent either, also this may sound mean but Sofia Vergara is possibly the most annoying actress alive, at least they didn&#39; t put a decent actress in the most annoying role in the film. I mean it&#39; s worth paying to see the excellent dance scene between Zefron and Pfieffer over the end credits. <br/><br/>OK, but basically it&#39; s exactly the same as Valentines Day but with more actors and a lot less substance. <br/><br/>Enjoy. Maybe. ",4
"NEW YEAR&#39; S EVE falls into that class of films best labeled &#39; cute&#39; . Lots of stories, most of little consequence, an attempt to pull everything together with the premise that new Year&#39; s Eve gives everyone a chance to make things different in the following year (the New Year&#39; s Resolution carried to the extreme), some funny jokes pushed over the edge toward silly, and a script full of holes. But the bouncing around from micro story to micro story works OK because it gives the actors involved a chance to come on set for a day or two of work and leave unstressed and financially healthy. Katherine Fugate wrote the stewed ingredient stories for Garry Marshall to stir, and the list of actors involved is staggering: Michelle Pfeiffer, Zac Efron, Robert De Niro, Halle Berry, Cary Elwes, Jessica Biel, Seth Meyers , Sarah Paulson, Til Schweiger, Carla Gugino, Katherine Heigl, Jon Bon Jovi, Sofía Vergara, Ashton Kutcher, Lea Michele, Sarah Jessica Parker, Abigail Breslin, Josh Duhamel, Larry Miller, Penny Marshall, Cherry Jones, Hilary Swank, Ludicrous, Hector Elizondo, Ryan Seacrest, Matthew Broderick, John Lithgow and more. <br/><br/>This is a razzle dazzle movie with some good moments, improbable though they mostly are, and a nice mindless evening to enjoy popcorn. Enter with low expectations and take it for what it is - entertainment. <br/><br/>Grady Harp",5
"I don&#39; t understand why anything happens in this movie. I don&#39; t understand why he fell in love with her just like that and why, all of the the sudden, she was interested too I don&#39; t understand why he goes to war and why his friends dies and she becomes a nurse, nor how that adds to the story And the only reason I see for his father to die is so she can conveniently go to his house and have sex without anyone bothering You won&#39; t see any character evolution. He will always be the simplistic, loyal, romantic nice guy, and she will be the noisy spoiled girl that never made any decision in her life. And they will always love each other, no matter what happened to them. Also, the old couple bits thrown in the middle were a bit unnecessary in my opinion. You could tell right away where they were going with it, which ruins that mind blowing ending they were trying to go for. They could have easily created a cute romantic ending in a more unexpected way. ",4
"Alright, first I shall note that I have not read the book. I hadn&#39; t even seen a trailer for this film before I had gone. I went with my mother and sister who had both read the book and more than enjoyed it. I really had no idea what this story was even about. I walked in with a completely open mind. <br/><br/>The acting in this movie was wonderful. On almost every account also. Greg Kinnear was amazing in the movie and the boy who played the son I was even impressed with. Miley Cyrus seemed to be the only exception. I hated her acting from the moment the movie began. As the movie went forth, I started to change my mind at times. She had no problem changing it back though. She was so off and on through out the entire film. She looked confused at times and when she actually had to show emotion like anger it was as if she didn&#39; t know what to do. But enough of that. <br/><br/>The story at times seemed rushed and misunderstood. Everything was predictable. The portions of the movie where I actually felt as though I was supposed to cry seemed to happen so fast that I felt like I didn&#39; t have time to understand how the characters felt. There were major holes in the plot that I still had questions about and it drove me nuts at times. There were a couple of times where I actually felt like I was enjoying it but they came and went quickly also. The whole movie, and please remember that I absolutely knew nothing about this story before hand, I felt like I had nothing to look forward to. <br/><br/>In the end I would say that I wouldn&#39; t suggest paying to see this in theaters. I definitely wouldn&#39; t buy it on DVD and I probably wouldn&#39; t even recommend renting it later. If by some chance you get an opportunity to see it for free and you&#39; re curious then go for it. I&#39; d also like to mention that, from what I understand from my mother and my sister, this movie completely differs from the book so don&#39; t expect what you&#39; ve read and definitely don&#39; t get to excited for this. ",4
"That&#39; s why sometimes I really should ignore IMDb&#39; s ratings! My parents went to see this movie last week and told me to watch it. And so I did it tonight. OK, Miley Cyrus isn&#39; t the best actress in the world and she&#39; s stuck to the Hanna Montana and so on kind of roles that she did. Even considering that, I don&#39; t get why do people hate her this much! She had a quite acceptable performance in this movie. I&#39; d give her a 6/10 stars rate, honestly believing that she&#39; ll improve a lot through her life as an actress. BUT WAIT! I really think we should rate this movie considering all the other things that compose it: a well-written and really moving story, an amazing soundtrack, a BRILLIANT Bobby Coleman&#39; s performance (WOOW! this kid will get very far in his career!) that almost made me shed a tear, a respectful cast, great landscapes and beautiful scenarios. . . There were some tiny moments with lack of total sense, and some slight errors of continuity, but totally harmless to the movie itself. Just stop hating the girl like she ruined the movie, because she did not do it at all. (and I swear I&#39; m not a MC fan)<br/><br/>Strongly recommended to watch with your lover!",7
"Miley Cyrus fans might hate me for saying this, but the makers of &quot; The Last Song&quot; should have hired a real actress for the lead role. Miley obviously doesn&#39; t have the talent or know how to act. I had nothing against her, but in this, the first role I&#39; ve seen her act in, it seemed like she was just playing herself and not playing any part that was written for her. <br/><br/>That said, &quot; The Last Song&quot; is a bust. It&#39; s a set of tired old recycled and clichéd experiences and really isn&#39; t worth the 107 minutes it takes to watch it. For the most part the storyline is so tired and old. And after watching it I was also disappointed that Greg Kinnear had signed up for it. That I can remember, I&#39; ve always liked his acting and the roles he chose. But in this case, the writing was so, so poor that even if the makers of &quot; The Last Song&quot; signed up the best actors in Hollywood it couldn&#39; t save this film. They&#39; d have to find some writers who were at a minimum mediocre-ish in order to improve this story. <br/><br/>All I can say is save yourself and watch something else. ",4
"I didn&#39; t read the book, didn&#39; t want to. A bunch of my friends went to go see this movie, and I went with them. There are a few things wrong with this movie. First, Miley Cyrus cannot act. I mean, at all. It&#39; s painful to watch. Second, there is no originality. Just mix up a bit Twilight and most of Dear John, and you&#39; ve got rather predictable The Last Song. Third, the characters. Ronnie is annoying enough without Cyrus, unbearable with her. She was such a brat at the beginning that I felt no pity the rest of the movie. Will makes several idiotic mistakes that cause Ronnie to have another temper tantrum. The little brother is cute, but irritating at times. Overall, this is just a flat, overrated chick flick that has the depth of a Disney Channel movie. ",4
"Enter Veronica &#39; Ronnie&#39; Miller, a recently graduated seventeen-year-old with an attitude problem, divorced parents, a fresh shoplifting arrest and combat boots. When Ronnie is sent from New York to Georgia to live with her dad for the summer, she is less than thrilled and at first resists letting anyone in. <br/><br/>Enter Will Blakelee, a rich small town &#39; hunk&#39; (if you will), with volleyball skill and charm. Not exactly a rebellious teen aged girl&#39; s cup of tea, right? Well. . . not quite. <br/><br/>Ronnie, played by Disney&#39; s princess Miley Cyrus, seems set not falling for anyone over the summer. But she ends up doing the opposite. Will&#39; s (Liam Hemsworth, Australian newbie) consistency pays off after just a couple of run-ins. He&#39; s writing &#39; Forever&#39; on Ronnie&#39; s converse and playfully pushing her into the ocean before she even comes to fairly good terms with her piano-playing father, Steve. (Greg Kinnear) The fast pace relationship was sweet, considering it&#39; s between teenagers. Nothing like cliché summer romance, huh? If only there was more depth to the relationship. . . (not counting Will&#39; s secretly damaged family, and Ronnie&#39; s dramatic anger towards her dad) . . . then maybe it would have been a more successful movie as a whole. <br/><br/>I&#39; m not going to blame Cyrus&#39; ability to act (or maybe lack thereof) on the low points of the film. I&#39; ll actually give it to her, she did a nice job transitioning from little miss Hannah Montana to a darker, not as tween-based character. There is always room for improvement, however, as she seems to get bored of her alter ego throughout the film. But all in all, I did find her likable for the most part. <br/><br/>At the end of the day, I cannot really complain or bash The Last Song. It was a debut in a lot of ways. . . Julie Anne Robinson&#39; s directorial debut, Nicholas Spark writing a screenplay debut, and Miley&#39; s debut as someone other than Hannah. So, cut it some slack. Excuse the sometimes cheesy moments and keep your mind open. <br/><br/>6/10, Not too shabby. ",6
"A fitting quote that speaks volumes of The Last Song, &quot; The pieces all fit together, yet everything was falling apart&quot; , expresses the opinions of the watchers of the movie. The Last Song, another installation in the line of Nicholas Sparks&#39; novels-turned-movies, centers on a teenage girl, her summer romance, and her relationship with her father. The movie features big names in acting, like Greg Kinnear and Kelly Preston, while spotlighting new faces in acting, for example Liam Hemsworth and Miley Cyrus. Although Cyrus is not a new celebrity name, The Last Song is her first silver screen acting role. Cyrus is a big name among tween girls for her role as Hannah Montana, and her singing career is starting to take off. However, acting in semi-serious roles or in movies at all might not be in her future. While Miley Cyrus does have a popular fan base to support her endeavors, The Last Song proves that Cyrus does not have the chops to be a great or even good actress, as expressed through her demeanor on screen, as well as through the reviews on her acting. <br/><br/>To illustrate the sub-par acting of Cyrus, the audience should pay close attention to how she acts. Even though the character of Ronnie was already a teen with a bad attitude, Cyrus adds the element of bad acting. In a review for the New York Times, writer A. O. Scott claims that Cyrus &quot;Most of the time she seems to be play-acting rather than exploring the motives and feelings of her character. &quot; Scott is absolutely true. Cyrus mopes around on screen, not really having much emotion or, when she does, it is sometimes exaggerated. For example, when Cyrus and Hemsworth guard the turtle eggs overnight, she does not really delve deeply into the emotions of her character, but rather just seems to be reading the lines. Claudia Puig, a reporter for USA Today, reports that Cyrus &quot; sulks and sneers her way through her first dramatic role&quot; , and that she has &quot; shaky dramatic bets. &quot; To counter the harsh reviews, Roger Ebert, a renowned movie critic, believes that Cyrus &quot; seems sincere&quot; and &quot; Her acting is unaffected, she can play serious. &quot; Cyrus may have some parts of the movie where she is serious, like when she and Kinnear finish the song and Kinnear&#39; s funeral, but most of the time she is not attached to her character. For most of The Last Song, Cyrus demonstrates how unexperienced her acting truly is. An example would be when she and Hemsworth have a fight around the middle of the movie. Cyrus explains to Hemsworth why she is mad at him, but Cyrus seems to not actually mean what she is saying; like she is just saying it to say it. Another scene in the movie that displays her less-than- stellar acting is another scene with Hemsworth. Again, she seems to be saying the lines, but not meaning them or having an ounce of conviction when the lines are spoken. Whenever Cyrus and Hemsworth have a scene together, which is almost every scene in the movie, Cyrus never gives the impression that she feels a romantic connection between her character and Hemsworth&#39; s character. The lack of chemistry could be a result from Cyrus&#39; s unemotional acting. ",4
"This is a perfect example of how to spoil a master piece. I am so sorry for Nicholas Sparks who wrote a wonderful book only to be ruined by a bad screenplay, terrible editing and ordinary acting. All those who have read the book should be able to appreciate what I am talking about. Julie Anne Robinson has tried to use her creativity and tweak the story here and there but all she has managed to do is to ruin the whole plot. Some things are just better left untouched is the lesson she should learn out of it. Miley Cyrus is a huge disappointment and it seems she wasn&#39; t a good choice in the first place. She failed miserably to do what Mandy Moore did to &quot; A Walk To Remember&quot; . On the whole, the movie gives the impression that they have just somehow managed to narrate the whole story in the 108 minutes given to them without really worrying about retaining the emotionally charged plot Nicholas Sparks had created. Thumbs down all the way : (",5
"I really wanted to like this film. I read the book when it came out; I am a gay man; I love films about love relationships between beautiful men; I love films with bits of European languages and lovely European settings; I am &#39; pro&#39; art house films which are all about characters and take their time. But this didn&#39; t work. Firstly, it was really too long. But my main problem was that the relationship between Elio and Oliver just didn&#39; t ring true. OK, a few small things happened between them which could have been seen as sexual (e. g. the shoulder massage), but they were both busy doing things with women a lot. Nothing wrong with being bi! And Elio is meant to be young, finding himself etc. But one day, he suddenly says to Oliver that he needs to tell him something, and Oliver says he knows what it is - but there really hasn&#39; t been enough evidence of that building up. I do realise that reading an article about Hammer which said that he had a clause added to his contract restricting the amount of sex and nudity he would be expected to do - well that made me struggle to see sincerity in his acting. Chalumet on the other hand is a great discovery. The way he holds a close-up all through the closing titles, showing a range of emotions, is very impressive indeed. I can remember so clearly what it was like at 17 (OK yes, 50 years ago) to kind of enjoy feeling sad and then elated about love and sex, and Chalumet shows that brilliantly. But he is not enough to save this film, and nor is the man playing his father, who does such an excellent job of channelling Robin Williams. ",5
"In this romantic black comedy, Maggie Gyllenhaal stars as Lee Holloway, the lady worker of the title. As you probably already know, this secretary doesn&#39; t just push pens and use paper clips, she has another, more exciting capacity as her boss&#39; s love object. The film actually isn&#39; t quite as naughty as many people think it thinks it is, but the truth is that the sadomasochistic area of the film isn&#39; t really all that important. The film isn&#39; t really about obscure sexual preferences, it&#39; s about finding someone whom you are comfortable with and the S&amp; M is just a means to an end. The sex aspect of the film does serve a purpose, however, in that it&#39; s that which makes the film a social satire of this culture of flirting in the office; a very over the top one, that is, and one that gives the film it&#39; s shock value; but to be honest, you don&#39; t really get to see that much bondage. The film is very original in it&#39; s portrayal of S&amp; M however, as it&#39; s a very taboo subject and for it to be portrayed in a sweet and upbeat manner like this is welcome and very different. <br/><br/>As mentioned, Maggie Gyllenhaal takes the title role and starring opposite her is James Spader as her boss. Gyllenhaal&#39; s character is sweet, inexperienced and bashful. She&#39; s very easy to like, but she can also be annoying at times. Spader&#39; s character is the complete opposite; despite being insecure, he comes across as being cold, calm and collected. He keeps his emotions hidden inside and reveals very little about himself, unlike Maggie&#39; s character who is happy to wear her emotions on her sleeve and doesn&#39; t seem to mind what other people think. Observe the way that the boss continues to tell her to put her shoes on because her feet stink etc; not exactly the most conscientious person to ever walk the earth. Despite being chalk and cheese, however, the two characters blend together in a way that is both believable and interesting, and this makes for some great chemistry between the two leads that is hard not to enjoy. The fact that they are chalk and cheese is a help and not a hindrance to the film as it serves in making it all the more interesting. My only quibble with the characterization is the ending, which although it brings the message out, seems tacked on and rather unrealisticbut it&#39; s not enough to spoil the film. <br/><br/>Overall, Secretary is not a masterpiece, but it is a very good portrayal love, and one that is far superior to dull and dreary films such as &#39; Lost in Translation&#39; . It&#39; s entertaining for it&#39; s duration, there are several funny moments and the central message, which states that it&#39; s worth going to extremes for the one you love is a worthwhile one for any movie, even if it is someone lost under the premise of the movie. Recommended. ",7
"Clearly, most of the people that thought this movie was genius were more titillated than anything. Yes, it&#39; s taboo. Yes it&#39; s intriguing. But it never really materialized in a smooth manner. I did appreciate the fact that the S and M stuff was introduced in a way that didn&#39; t insult the audience, taking the viewers seriously and insinuating they knew what this was all about. But for those that didn&#39; t understand, the film was pretty dull. <br/><br/>Sadly, the film just didn&#39; t take the subject far enough. While the progression of pleasure gathered by the characters was quite effective, a lot of little annoyances just kept getting in the way. Maggie Gyllenhaal&#39; s mental illness was too overplayed in the second half of the film, and then hokie moments like her pleasuring herself in the bathroom and the big crowds outside the lawyers&#39; office really kind of knocked the film out of its continuous dark turn. In the hands of a more capable writing-directing team, this film would be pretty good. But with it already made, we&#39; ll have to stuck with this film until something better comes along. ",4
I can feel the warmth in the chemistry between Anna Paquin and Holliday Grainger. Two lonely and sad characters finding happiness in each other. The movie was better than expected. And the message and narrative are still relevant today. Because lesbian relationships are still frowned upon in some societies. ,7
"Don&#39; t get me wrong, I did like this film. The fashion style and the two main actresses don&#39; t disappoint. However, I&#39; m not sure why they chose to diverge so much from such a well done book and the happy ending of it? The departure from the flow of the book made the last half hour feel clunky. ",7
"Greetings again from the darkness. Secrets and lies become a tangled web of messiness that impacts lives and relationships in this story adapted from Fiona Shaw&#39; s 2009 novel. Annabel Jankel (known for her music videos and as a creator of Max Headroom) directs the script from sisters Henrietta and Jessica Ashworth, and we learn that this rural community in 1952 Scotland is filled with judgmental and close-minded folks unable to accept that some don&#39; t live and love according to society&#39; s general rules of the time. <br/><br/>Holliday Grainger (&quot; The Borgias&quot; ) stars as Lydia, mother to young Charlie (Gregor Selkirk), and the two have recently been abandoned by husband -father Robert (Emun Elliott). Charlie is a sensitive boy - in touch with nature, and observant to his mother&#39; s emotional strains. After a schoolyard scuffle, Charlie is treated by the town&#39; s new doctor, Dr. Markham (Anna Paquin, &quot; True Blood&quot; ), who not only treats his bruises, but also teaches him about the bees and hives in her garden. She lets him know that telling your secrets to the bees keeps them from flying away. <br/><br/>Dr. Markham has returned to the community where she grew up, and the rumors of her teenage years have not faded. Her father recently passed and she has returned to her roots to take his place as the local doctor. When Lydia gets sacked at the factory where she works (by Kate Dickie&#39; s Pam, her spinster sister-in-law/supervisor), Dr. Markham hires Lydia as a housekeeper and invites her and Charlie to move into the house left to her by her father. <br/><br/>&quot; This town is too small for secrets&quot; is not simply a line of dialogue, but easily could have been the title of the films. As Charlie tells his secrets to the bees, Lydia and Dr. Markham grow closer . . . creating confusion for Charlie, challenges for the two women, and disgust within the community. Robert is a brut of a man, and threatens Lydia in every way a simple man might. There is also a subplot around Lydia&#39; s younger sister-in-law Annie (Lauren Lyle), who is pregnant from a secretive interracial relationship. What follows is a vicious response from the close-minded folks previously mentioned. <br/><br/>An older Charlie is our narrator, and most of the story is told from his point of view. Secrets kept by children are contrasted by those of adults, and it&#39; s clear that both cause harm. The first part of the movie is beautifully filmed, though the story structure wobbles a bit in the second half. There are many fascinating close-ups of bees and hives, although a mystical/supernatural sequence is difficult to buy. Excellent acting is on display throughout, especially by young Gregor Selkirk and Ms. Grainger, whose face the camera loves. The film is quite tastefully done, and focused as much on the small-minded town folks reaction as the blossoming relationship between the two leads. A stronger third act would have elevated the film, though the first half hour is well done. ",6
"The director draws excellent performances from the two female leads (playing Lydia and Dr Jean) and also from the very capable supporting cast. The cinematography and production design capture the ambience and restrictive social mores of the &quot; small&quot; 1950s Scottish mill town quite convincingly. The story is less convincing about the symbolism of the bees (which is presumably derived from the book). We see too many random extreme close-ups of bees, Lydia&#39; s son Charlie sharing his secrets with the bees in their hives, and in the last 20 minutes of the movie, an incident which implies that the bees have developed some sort of preternatural relationship with the boy. This latter aspect, particularly, seems rather incongruous with the otherwise quite adult themed lesbian romance story. It strikes me as a movie primarily to be enjoyed for its great character acting. ",7
"So many lost opportunities here. . . Holliday Grainger was the best part of this film. Really read the book, it doesn&#39; t disappoint. ",5
"I would like to answer &quot; SadnessNeverGoes&quot; who in 139 words, 8 punctuations and no capital letters whatsoever ecxept the first word &quot; Is&quot; , gave it a 2. Are you liveing in the same time as me ?
It might not be a masterpiece - I read the book, and it contained much more of the reality of the times, but the film also contains an awareness that the book lacked. I liked it. I did not like &quot; SadnessNeverGoes&quot; . ",7
"Charlie is a young boy trying to understand the world. His father Robert Weekes (Emun Elliott) is a brutal man who has abandoned him and his mother Lydia (Holliday Grainger). Charlie befriends Jean Markham (Anna Paquin) who keeps bees in her yard. She had recently returned home after her father&#39; s death. She&#39; s a woman&#39; s doctor and a lesbian which must be kept secret back then in a small village. When Lydia and Charlie get evicted, they move in with Jean. Slowly, Jean succumbs to Lydia and the secret cannot be kept hidden. <br/><br/>Charlie is a problem. His turn is a problem. It&#39; s hard to understand his action when the movie doesn&#39; t seem to know him either. It needs to be set up better. His motivation is like a swarm of bees. It&#39; s hard to know which one is important and which one is not. Does he like his father? He fears being taken away but he&#39; s running away. Does he expect his family to be reunited? He&#39; s obsessed with secrets but what exactly does he know? What does he understand about love or sex? He doesn&#39; t seem to know and the movie is unable to specify his understanding. It may help to have an even younger actor in the role which would excuse his confusion. There is also the matter with the bees. It&#39; s a magical premise but the movie does not have the surreal magic needed to pull it off. While I appreciate the intended message, the movie never strays away from preaching its views. This could work but Charlie is a problem. ",5
"I wanted to like this; rarely do filmmakers sensitively portray romance between women and not for the male gaze. But it suffers from the same issues we saw in lesbian movies of the past: the development just wasn&#39; t quite there for the characters, every possible tired theme from lesbian films is thrown at us, including the ending, which frankly, bothers me to no end because it makes NO sense. I can&#39; t help but think there is an underlying homophobic conspiracy to pretty much every &quot; lesbian&quot; film. I&#39; m just plain sick of it. Seriously, is there a master class taught to every director and producer in how to make a lesbian film crash and burn to discourage women from entering into relationships together?<br/><br/>The acting is okay, but not quite at the level I expected. Anna Paquin straight up fumbles during the romantic scenes (fine, we can buy that she&#39; s scared and shy as her character would be? Except she&#39; s the more experienced one with women according to the plot. . . hmmmm) but she legit doesn&#39; t know where on the other actor&#39; s face to kiss, looking like she wants to swallow her face whole. The intimate scene also has the feel of a scene between two actors who really don&#39; t want to do this part; no chemistry and just oddly executed. It was so awkward that it was hard to watch. <br/><br/>The boy&#39; s view and storyline with the bees. . . . a little hokey and not executed quite as well, either. This just isn&#39; t going to be up to your expectations if you want more than tropes. <br/><br/>Try Between Two Women instead: set in working class England in the 1950s (mother and her artistically-gifted son and his teacher), understated and well made, nostalgic, and doesn&#39; t follow the same formula as many lesbian films do. ",4
"When I first saw the trailer for this film it brought tears to my eyes. It seemed to me like it was going to be a roller coaster of emotions, and I really expected it to be one of the best films of the year. Don&#39; t get me wrong, it is by no means a bad movie. The acting is without a doubt some of the best that I have seen, and I believe that both Adam Driver and Scarlett Johansson deserve Oscar nominations for how well they did in the film. Unfortunately, I personally was not all that affected by their emotional performances, and had a lot of trouble connecting with their characters. I think older audiences, as well as anyone who has been through a divorce will connect with the film a lot more than I did. That was really my big problem with the film, apart from their child being extremely annoying at times. Other than that, the film is very well made, I did not get bored at any point, although I think it could have been 10 minutes shorter. If it were not for the fact that I felt no attachment to the characters, I would likely give this film a much higher review, likely an 8 or a 9, but I just really wasn&#39; t feeling it. Still, definitely a great film in every other regard, and I am likely in the minority about how I felt about the characters, so I would recommend giving it a watch so you can form your own opinion on it. ",6
"I came in to this movie hoping for something resembling a story of two adults doing what&#39; s best for their child even though they were going through a divorce. What I got was one adult, Charlie (Adam Driver) being dragged through a river of crap by his selfish, child of a wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson). <br/><br/>Although the writers make an effort to portray Nicole as a victim by virtue of her moving to NYC to be with Charlie, the film backtracks on that narrative by Nicole&#39; s own admission that she was miserable in L. A. because of her then boyfriend. Nicole needed a change of scenery. Enter Charlie. She met him, moved to NYC, married him, worked with him to create a successful business, and then pulled the rug out from under him once his fame began to surpass her own. <br/><br/>In an effort to justify her behavior, Nicole alludes to an &quot; affair&quot; Charlie had, but we later learn that it only occurred after he and Nicole were separated but under the same roof. As Charlie put it, he was sleeping on the couch at that point and living with a woman who loathed him for his success and her belief that she gave up too much when she (voluntarily) left L. A. <br/><br/>Every act taken by Nicole in this film screams of weakness and insecurity. Nicole can be pushed and pulled in whatever direction anyone wants her to take. She and Charlie agree that they don&#39; t want a nasty divorce. So, what does she do? She hires the nastiest divorce lawyer in L. A. at the suggestion of a woman she has known for five minutes. She moves their son to L. A. under false pretenses and files for divorce in L. A. Why? Because her attorney told her to. The goal? To make sure Charlie has to hire an L. A. lawyer at great expense. You see, she knows he can&#39; t afford to fight for custody in L. A. But is that enough? Nope. Nicole then goes all over L. A. meeting with other divorce attorneys. Why does she do this (with her kid in tow mind you) when she already has an attorney? To create a conflict of interest in case Charlie wanted to retain a competent attorney of his own. Attorneys can&#39; t work with Charlie once she has poisoned the well you see. She does all this to make sure Charlie can&#39; t see his child. Meanwhile, she acknowledges how great of a dad he is. &quot; He does the things for their son that should bother him, and enjoys doing it. To the point that she hates him for it&quot; . <br/><br/>This was all done before Charlie even knows what&#39; s coming. In the meantime, Nicole continues to shower Charlie with praise and assure him she wants what&#39; s best for both of them. But, you see, Nicole is a coward. She cannot fight her own fights, and despite paying tens of thousands of dollars for her attorney (but first making sure that Charlie has to pay 30% of it), she forces her sister to serve Charlie with divorce papers. Why would she make her sister do this when it would only cost a couple hundred bucks to have it done by an actual process server? Well, because this hurts more. Charlie is close with Nicole&#39; s family. In fact, it&#39; s the only family he has and has ever had. So, naturally, Nicole wants his sister in law to serve him with the divorce papers. &quot; You have to take a side&quot; she tells her mom. &quot; You can&#39; t have a relationship with Charlie anymore&quot; under any circumstances. Why? Because, it&#39; s about the hurt. Nicole is an insecure child. Her only satisfaction in this film comes from forcing others to share in her misery. <br/><br/>As Nicole drags everyone else into her miserable existence with the hope that it will prop her up, Charlie continues propping up others around him despite his misery. He is a legitimately good person who doesn&#39; t deserve the hand he is being dealt. In a fruitless effort to fight for his child, he throws away a $625, 000 grant which was supposed to be used for his business. He becomes a victim to a society and a court system that assumes fathers are pieces of crap while mothers can do no wrong. Ironically, at one point in the film Nicole&#39; s rabid attorney states the exact opposite, that Nicole needs to be perfect but Charlie can be a buffoon. Those who live in reality know that is not the case. It takes something bordering on child endangerment before a mother loses priority when it comes to custody. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Charlie does what every man seems to do in these films. He loses. First he loses his wife because she decides on a whim that New York is no longer good enough. Then he loses his son when she moves him to L. A. under the cover of night. Finally, Charlie loses his livelihood when he can no longer afford to keep the theater open and has to choose between his life&#39; s work and his son. As the film closes we see that he has lost once more. He has lost his will to fight. He takes a menial job in Los Angeles (to Nicole&#39; s dismay mind you) directing small bit plays. His status as an up and coming Broadway director is gone. Nicole has gotten everything she wanted without even the tiniest compromise. Charlie has lost everything. He has been handed a pile of crap by his wife and is being told in no uncertain terms that he will eat it and tell her how great it tastes. If he refuses, he won&#39; t see his child. <br/><br/>While it is obvious that Johannson is not Nicole, she embodies her completely, and I personally wonder if I will enjoy her other movies in the future given how despicable a character Nicole is in this film. 5 stars out of 10 for the acting and direction, but the way Nicole&#39; s character was written makes me wonder what the goal of this film is. It certainly is not intended to make anyone feel good about the state of humanity as it currently exists. ",5
Surprised at the glowing reviews. It was ok but fairly predictable and an unsatisfying ending. Better acted by Adam Driver. Scarlett Johansson is a bit wooden in many scenes. And a word to both Adam and Scarlett: Don&#39; t sing. Just don&#39; t. ,5
"Despite its unsavory sadomasochistic subject matter, this cinematic adaptation of author E. L. James&#39; erotic bestseller &quot; Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; qualifies as puritanical. I can say this because I managed to get through ten chapters of the book before I saw the Universal Pictures release. &quot; Nowhere Boy&quot; director Sam Taylor-Johnston and &quot; Saving Mr. Banks&quot; scenarist Kelly Marcel have sanitized James&#39; novel and turned it into an antiseptic, &quot; Cinderella&quot; fairy tale about an affluent Prince Charming and a book-wormy English Lit major. Not that it matters, director Sam Taylor-Johnston is a woman rather than a man. Johnston and Marcel have forged a film that features simulated sex scenes without steam and cardboard characters without souls. Mind you, &quot; Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; isn&#39; t as abysmal as the amateurish &quot; Addicted. &quot; Johnston stages several sex scenes where actress Dakota Johnson bares only her breasts, while actor Jamie Dornan displays little more than his carefully sculpted abs and buttocks. Ladies hoping for a glimpse of male genitalia are going to be sorely frustrated because &quot; Fifty Shades&quot; is R-rated rather than NC-17, like both &quot; Shame&quot; (2011) and &quot; The Lover&quot; (1992) where full frontal nudity was conspicuous. Comparatively speaking, little if anything risqué occurs until the concluding scene. You won&#39; t see anything like the candle dripping sex in the Madonna movie &quot; Body of Evidence&quot; (1993); the kitchen sink sex between Michael Douglas and Glenn Close in &quot; Fatal Attraction, &quot; or the infamous &quot; Last Tango in Paris&quot; where Marlon Brando improvised on Maria Schneider with a blob of butter. Subsequent adaptations of James&#39; two novels may pass up on the prudish approach after Universal studio executives have analyzed audience tolerance. Altogether, this soft-porn entry in the trilogy shouldn&#39; t hoist anybody&#39; s eyebrows. <br/><br/>Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnston of &quot; The Five Year Engagement&quot; ) is a shy, virginal, doe-eyed brunette who majors in English Lit at Washington State University and works at a hardware store. She shares an apartment with her best friend, blond-haired Kate Kavanagh (Eloise Mumford of &quot; In the Blood&quot; ), who serves as the campus newspaper editor. As the action unfolds, woebegone, pajama-clad Kate is wrestling with a cold. Kate persuades Anastasia to pinch hit for her on a newspaper assignment. She sends her out to interview bachelor billionaire Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan of &quot; Marie Antoinette&quot; ) who rules a colossal corporate empire. Basically, Christian is the Bruce Wayne of hanky-spanky. An orphan who survived the death of his crack-addict mom, Christian has amassed a fortune, but he harbors a deep, dark secret. When she enters &#39; The House of Grey, &#39; Anastasia knows little about him. Anxious about her assignment, Anastasia makes a klutz of herself when she enters Grey&#39; s office. No sooner has she crossed the threshold than she stumbles and crumples to her hands and knees. Realizing she hasn&#39; t made the best impression, Anastasia recovers her confidence and begins the interview. Initially, Christian adopts an icy attitude toward her, but he thaws out once they start talking. Christian finds the way Anastasia chews her lip so irresistible that he cancels his next appointment. Some of Kate&#39; s questions shock Anastasia, particularly when she quizzes the tycoon about his sexual orientation. A life-long bachelor who has never been photographed in public with a woman, Christian explains that he has little use for conventional romances with hearts and flowers. A relieved Anastasia leaves Christian behind in his phallic monolith of a building and cruises home. As it turns out, Anastasia is just as captivated with Christian as the latter is with her. Later, they go on a date, and eventually he deflowers her. He wants Anastasia to join him in a sexual liaison as a &#39; submissive&#39; to his &#39; dominant. &#39; Christian and she negotiate terms of a contract. For example, the open-minded Anastasia has no problems with being tied up and titillated with a peacock feather, but she draws the line at vaginal fisting and genital clamps. Meantime, Christian does everything he can to corrupt Anastasia, buying her a Mac notebook and replacing her classic Volkswagen Beetle with a shiny red Audi. Ultimately, Christian convinces our heroine to let him show her how bondage can be enjoyable. Nevertheless, Anastasia isn&#39; t as gullible as she seems. At fade-out, she gains the upper hand in their bizarre relationship. <br/><br/>The casting in &quot; Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; creates half of the problem. Dakota Johnson makes an ideal Anastasia. She gives a believable performance as a naïve college student who has just graduated and treasures the kind classic 19th century British fiction that Thomas Hardy wrote. The Austin, Texas, born actress seems wholly comfortable with her casual nudity, and it is interesting to note that &quot; Miami Vice&#39; s&quot; Don Johnson is her dad and Melanie Griffith of &quot; Something Wild&quot; is her mom. She isn&#39; t as goofy as her literary counterpart. Sadly, lean, handsome Jamie Dornan doesn&#39; t cut the mustard. He doesn&#39; t behave like a ruthless cutthroat who owns a billion dollar corporation, and his performance is considerably less spontaneous. Although he wears his apparel well and delivers his dialogue with crisp precision, Dornan looks more like a callow amateur. In all fairness to Dornan, he impersonates a character that doesn&#39; t seem remotely believable, and his lack of personality underlines his lightweight performance. The other big problem is the film seems as impersonal as a bargain basement torture rack. Basically, Johnston and Marcel have designed it as a bondage primer that cautiously advances from one elaborate interlude to another without drumming up any melodrama. Primarily, the filmmakers rely more on winks rather than winces as our heroine navigates the dire straits of Christian&#39; s sexual calisthenics. Keep in mind, Anastasia doesn&#39; t say no until she knows better. Gradually, Christian peels back the layers of his paranoia, revealing himself as an onion that initiates our heroine&#39; s tears and fears. When director Sam Johnston shifts the focus from the game of sexual chess between Anastasia and Christian, the film sacrifices suspense. Undeniably, &quot; Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; will keep your eyes wide open, but it dwells more on tease instead of sleaze. ",5
"Before the review, I think I should address one important thing: I have never read the book. That being said, you will not read any comparisons or critiques of what was left out or what was done wrong in the adaptation. I went into this movie aware of the subject matter and judged it just like any other movie. Consider this a fair review of &quot; Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; . <br/><br/>Honestly, I liked this movie. I know what you&#39; re thinking: &quot; This guy just likes seeing people have kinky sex on the big screen. &quot; No, I don&#39; t. In fact, I think mainstream erotic films offer us more than just artsy porn; they can be a fascinating look into the human subconscious like &quot; Eyes Wide Shut&quot; and they can be pure garbage like &quot; Caligula&quot; . I have come to learn that art is not safe whether it&#39; s in the horror genre, comedy or especially in the erotic subgenre. Strangely, I found &quot; Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; to be provocative of questions about love, compromise, and passion even if it borders on what most people would consider bad taste. <br/><br/>First off, what is the movie about? Basically it follows the relationship between an inhibited English student named Anastasia Steele (played by Dakota Johnson) and a mysterious, young billionaire named Christian Grey (played by Jamie Dornan). They meet for an interview and begin building an infatuation for one another but Grey keeps insisting he does not want a romance with Ana. Instead he offers her the chance to partake in a BDSM relationship in which he is the dominant and she is the submissive. When I look back, the roles match well with their personalities. <br/><br/>There is no real story I could find in this film; rather it&#39; s more about the characters. A lot of great movies focus on their characters more than plot; in this movie, it works out okay. Many of the supporting characters are snubbed for the two main players as if to say they are just there for the sake of some filler. Maybe if others found out about Grey&#39; s lifestyle and he was caught in media frenzy, the film would have a substantial plot. <br/><br/>I found Dakota Johnson to be incredibly dull in the first act but gradually she becomes more dynamic and confident as the film progressed. It feels intentional seeing how Ana starts off as a quiet, uninteresting woman only to morph into a more liberal persona. Dakota&#39; s character has a lot of those &quot; whomp-whomp-whomp-whooooomp&quot; comedic moments in the beginning which felt so forced and unnecessary to the tone. Jamie Dornan was decent as Christian Grey. Like his character, he feels in control. <br/><br/>The sex scenes are a lot tamer than I had anticipated going into this flick. Like the rest of the movie, they are shot surprisingly crisp and, might I add, nicely-paced. <br/><br/>It sounds like a simple movie but it wasn&#39; t until I asked myself one simple question that it all became interesting: Does Grey love Ana? A lot of Grey&#39; s actions I see points to yes unless it is part of a ploy to secure a potential submissive. He claims to require a written contract before ever touching Ana but blows off this condition to passionately kiss her. And once they get to the contract, they discuss their intimate limitations in an amusing, business-like setting. Ana objects to certain practices which Grey seems to willingly extract from their relationship kind of like a compromise in any other relationship. <br/><br/>One of my favorite parts is when Ana confesses her virginity to Grey after revealing his secret life. Even though he maintains he doesn&#39; t have normal sexual relations in the bedroom, Grey breaks this code to be with Ana. One might argue it is a selfish act to gain her trust so she may serve as his victim; I see it as Grey finding an opportunity to be with someone he could briefly connect with, someone untouched, someone he sees as good. In fact, at one point, he voices his concern of Ana changing his outlook on life and sounds scared of this prospect. Grey feels constrained by his past which shaped his present only to feel the need to constrain others to his level, literally. <br/><br/>Who knows? Maybe I&#39; m overthinking too much. Some people might be turned off, some might get turned on, some might think little about it, and some might find something special in &quot; Fifty Shades of Grey&quot; . I only know what I saw and felt. <br/><br/>My Rating: 7/10",7
"**WARNING: Contains plot spoilers**<br/><br/>I don&#39; t normally write reviews but this is a case where the critics seem to be totally disconnected from what they are supposed to be reviewing. It is weird to see so little dissent in the press about this film. Carol has many good points but more bad points. <br/><br/>The good points are the amazing production design and costumes, and the interesting 16mm cinematography (which does get quite grainy at times). The technical side of things is fine, it looks very beautiful and old-fashioned. <br/><br/>The main problem is that there just isn&#39; t any emotional connection established between the two main characters, or between anyone really. The film doesn&#39; t make you care about people or their fates, and doesn&#39; t explain why they would care about each other. <br/><br/>The very first meeting between Carol and Therese highlights this. Carol tries to seduce Therese because. . . well, she just does, from the very first moment she lays eyes on her in the department store. We don&#39; t know why, Carol has never met her before so presumably it&#39; s just because Therese is young and pretty. We don&#39; t even see Carol reacting to Therese&#39; s beauty, Carol just has this predatory gaze from the very first frame, as if she was determined to find someone, anyone. How much sympathy would we feel for a middle-aged married man doing these things instead of Carol?<br/><br/>Because of the way the story unfolds, it is also very hard to shake the feeling that Carol is a rich person who is, in the end, able to get whatever she wants. <br/><br/>There ought to be sympathy for Carol being stuck in a dead marriage, but she is getting divorced and already having an affair. <br/><br/>There ought to be sympathy for Carol losing custody of her daughter Rindy, but we never really see the mother-daughter relationship enough to understand what this means to her. For example, in the first scene Carol buys her daughter a train set instead of a doll in order to impress the young shop assistant that she lusts after. We later see Carol playing with the train set by herself while thinking of her own problems, we never see the daughter using it. The daughter seems to be little more than a plot device or a prop. <br/><br/>There ought to be sympathy for gay lovers being parted by a bigoted 1950s society, but we never really see them as lovers. We see them make love, but there isn&#39; t really a scene where they display any kind of chemistry or deep affection. They come together because. . . well, they just do. To make matters worse, they split up almost as soon as they have got together, so we don&#39; t really get the time to feel anything significant has been lost. <br/><br/>The saddest part is when Carol dumps Therese so she can go to fight for her daughter&#39; s custody, but then when, thanks to her lawyer&#39; s manoeuvrings, Carol has a realistic chance of getting joint custody of her daughter, she waives her rights to it. Why? Because it means she can avoid the hassle of a nasty court case. How deep can Carol&#39; s love for Rindy or Therese really be if these are her priorities? And why tell us that the custody of Rindy means so much, more than her love for Therese, and then show her abandoning custody? Perhaps the novel explains why this makes sense, but the film certainly doesn&#39; t. <br/><br/>The two hour running time should have been long enough to get proper emotional connections built up, but instead the director squanders it on overextended scenes that should have been much shorter. It makes the whole film drag on without any character development. <br/><br/>At one point Carol&#39; s husband Hodge has a door slammed in his face, it ends on a nice shot of his partially-covered features, but it then goes on to show him walking away from the house, getting in a car and driving off. Extending the scene didn&#39; t serve any purpose, we know he&#39; s annoyed and isolated but he&#39; s been annoyed and isolated for the entire film. Another example has Carol and Therese arriving in a hotel, they enter the lobby, they enter the room, they admire the room and then. . . it cuts to them leaving the hotel. What did we learn about them from this? That they enjoy the decor of expensive hotels? Wouldn&#39; t, for example, adding a scene earlier in the film showing Carol doing nothing but playing with her daughter Rindy been a better way to build up the emotional stakes?<br/><br/>&quot; Carol&quot; seems to be the kind of film where the subject matter and the reputation of the participants has totally replaced objective assessment of the work itself. <br/><br/>Gay rights are important, Blanchett is a great actor and Haynes is a great director. &quot; Carol&quot; is not an important or great film though, it&#39; s telling the story of an affair without telling us why the affair happened or why we should care. Its reviews seem to be based on what &quot; Carol&quot; should have been, rather than what it actually is. ",4
"I had been looking forward to this film for months, and upon finally viewing it- it&#39; s a huge disappointment. Todd Haynes, who&#39; s finest achievement is still Far From Heaven (2002), has a knack for creating intimate atmospheres with radiant colors and backdrops. Like Far from Heaven, he succeeds with the aesthetic values of the 1950s by giving us refined art direction and beautiful costumes. Unlike Far from Heaven, we are given wooden characters and a predictable script, with a score by Carter Burwell that sounds exactly like Philip Glass&#39; s creation for The Hours (2002). <br/><br/>Rooney Mara works in a department store, and finds herself attracted to Cate Blanchett, a well to do married woman who flirts with her while shopping for Christmas presents. Later they have lunch, and in the only truly well acted scene in the film, seem to connect almost instantaneously. The dialogue here is cleverly limited- so we can instead watch the suggestive gestures of both characters that indicate sexual attraction- and tension. It&#39; s too bad this is the only scene I felt was able to capture this. The rest of the movie unfolds like a poorly written episode of the series Mad Men, as the women keep meeting up secretly whilst the husband gets suspicious and even hires a detective to follow them to a hotel so he can later gain custody of Blanchett&#39; s child. This is because homosexuality is &quot; naughty&quot; . <br/><br/>Perhaps the reason I felt bored watching Carol was that the material is old and tired. Sexual repression in the 50s? We&#39; ve seen this so many times. Brokeback Mountain (2005) also dealt with homosexuality with two men- and with much sharper direction and a more interesting story. The actors there were also more believable. Speaking of the acting, Cate Blanchett is indeed the standout. She&#39; s not nearly as strong as I had heard or hoped for, but she&#39; s none the less ravishing and breathtaking to gaze upon. She&#39; s at the peek of her career now, with 2 Oscars under her belt, and indeed Carol should easily earn her a deserved 7th nomination. But besides a juicy scene towards the end, the character isn&#39; t that intriguing. There&#39; s a lot to be desired, and that easily could be the fault of the screenwriter (Phyllis Nagy), who adapted the script. Yes I get it- it&#39; s supposed to be subtle, but this character felt empty. Blanchett is a fine actress- we could have gotten some more fire from her character. <br/><br/>Rooney Mara is even more flat. She relies simply on her pretty face. I kept thinking Natalie Portman would have exuded so much more energy with the role, since both women have similar physical dynamics to their facial structures. Mara just comes off weak. There&#39; s not an ounce of integrity or feeling coming through with this performance. If that&#39; s how she was supposed to play it, then the fault lies in the director. How she won at Cannes is beyond me. She&#39; s not impressive at all. She&#39; s pretty, but that doesn&#39; t constitute good acting. <br/><br/>The rest of the cast is easily forgettable. Sarah Paulson has a thankless role, and she&#39; s usually very good (watch her in 12 Years a Slave). Mara&#39; s boyfriend is the worst acting I&#39; ve seen all year; very high school drama club. Everyone else is going through their lines in a robotic tone. <br/><br/>This could have been an exceptional film. And I&#39; m in the minority who didn&#39; t like it (it&#39; s currently one of the top reviewed films of 2015, and destined to be crowned with nominations on Oscar morning). But it left me feeling cold, and bored. I might just be sick of seeing movies about the 1950s and how everyone couldn&#39; t &quot; talk about things like being gay, and sex, and racial relations&quot; back then. The subject has been hammered over my head too many times. But the trailer for this movie was a love letter. Why couldn&#39; t the movie be the same? Mara and Blanchett are supposed to be in love, and yet their first meeting aside- I never really felt a true connection between them. There was never enough juice in their chemistry for me to believe it. ",5
"I&#39; ll try to be brief, since the film wasn&#39; t. <br/><br/>Visually, this was a satisfying film to watch. Like looking through an old photo album from the 1950s, beautifully shot. <br/><br/>Narratively, it was an utterly predictable story, without a single twist, every plot point telegraphed and seen miles in advance. <br/><br/>Rooney, reminiscent of a beautifully boyish young Demi Moore, was quite good, though her character&#39; s relationship to the boyfriend Richard was not particularly nuanced. A little more ambivalence on her character&#39; s part toward the relationship would&#39; ve created some needed tension. <br/><br/>Blanchet was interesting, but in a one-dimensional kind of way. She was beautiful, but her manner and delivery seemed superficial and artificial. I&#39; m a bit undecided as to whether these were traits with which she was intentionally trying to imbue the character of Carol, or whether this is how she plays all her characters. <br/><br/>This is a mainstream drama, a vehicle for the stars to garner Oscar nominations. A far cry from Haynes&#39; far superior Far From Heaven, however. Watchable, for sure, but for me only once. ",5
"&#39; Carol&#39; is a fine film. The juxtaposition of the lavish costumes and production design with the grainy look of 16mm film sells the film&#39; s old-fashioned aesthetic. It is a well-shot film that is pleasant to look at. All of the individual performances are pretty good. <br/><br/>The best part of the film is the opening sequence. The credits play over a continuing shot of fifties New York accompanied by Carter Burwell&#39; s fantastic piece &#39; Opening&#39; . This shot brings us to a scene in a restaurant. This is a flash-forward that we revisit later on in the film. Our first sight of the main couple occurs when a man at the bar looks around the restaurant and spots them at a table. In this shot, Therese (Rooney Mara) and Carol (Cate Blanchett) are sitting at a table. Therese is sat facing away from the camera and towards Carol, who we can see clearly. My immediate reaction to this sight was &quot; Wow, Cate Blanchett genuinely looks like she&#39; s in love. &quot; It felt real. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, I didn&#39; t get this feeling from the rest of the film. I couldn&#39; t feel any chemistry between Therese and Carol. Mara and Blanchett do their best with what they are given, but they aren&#39; t given enough. Their characters don&#39; t feel fleshed out. I didn&#39; t feel like I knew them as people by the end. The film&#39; s technical achievements can only lift a film so high. If you love this film then I&#39; m glad, but I can&#39; t love it when I couldn&#39; t grow attached to the characters. This is especially a problem as this feels like a film driven more by character than by story. <br/><br/>Despite what I have said, this film didn&#39; t bore me. Mara and Blanchett are both engaging actresses who command your attention even if they aren&#39; t given enough to work with. The film is on the slow side but it goes at the right pace for what director Todd Haynes and screenwriter Phyllis Nagy were going for. Overall, it was an interesting experience that felt a bit empty. <br/><br/>You can see more reviews at http: //letterboxd. com/lloyd_morgan/films/reviews/",7
"In 1950s America, Carol is nearing the end of a quietly unhappy marriage to Harge, and trying to retain custody of their daughter Rindy. There is a morality clause and Carol&#39; s lesbian tendencies bring this to bear, especially when she falls for Therese, and a relationship gradually begins to blossom. <br/><br/>I was expecting great things from this film: Cate Blanchett as Carol and Rooney Mara as Therese have both been getting glowing notices. And those notices are richly deserved: both women are first rate. I wish I could say the same for the film. There are two strong plot elements here: the legal wrangle and the growing (and forbidden) relationship. The film should have been electrifying. But it is slow and, regrettably, boring. I know that you don&#39; t have to take a film at breakneck speed but, given the drama inherent in the two major plot threads, not only does not very much happen, it happens very slowly. <br/><br/>I&#39; m sure this will be up for bags of awards (I get the impression that it regards itself as Important), but I was disappointed.

"Unlike the sentimental melodrama &quot; Brooklyn, &quot; Director Todd Haynes has fashioned a more salacious tale based on Patricia Highsmith&#39; s 1952 novel &quot; The Price of Salt&quot; (later named &quot; Carol&quot; ). Like his predecessor, Douglas Sirk, the grandmaster of the 1950s melodrama, you can always count on Haynes to deliver the goods in terms of brilliant cinematography, bravura acting (this time provided by Cate Blanchett and Rooney Mara) as well as a production design that magnificently recreates the heady days of the early 1950s, just as Dwight D. Eisenhower ascends the &quot; throne&quot; of the American presidency for the first time. Despite all the positives, why then is &quot; Carol&quot; simply &quot; average&quot; and mediocre to boot?<br/><br/>When Highsmith&#39; s novel came out in 1952, a lesbian romance was considered fairly scandalous. Indeed, when the film&#39; s protagonist, Carol Aird, begins a lesbian affair with salesgirl Therese Belivet, the villain of the piece, Carol&#39; s rather mean and pathetic husband, Harge, invokes a &quot; morality clause, &quot; permitting him to gain full custody of the couple&#39; s young daughter, Rindy, without the possibility of Carol having any visitation rights. <br/><br/>Carol&#39; s ensuing decision to get away from it all and inviting Therese on a sensual whirlwind of a cross country car trip may have been shocking for 1950s readers, but today it feels like old hat. We&#39; re supposed to get excited about the two lovers&#39; intense desire for one another but what&#39; s so original about a lesbian romance? It&#39; s simply not enough on which to hang your hat on for an entire movie. True, at the midpoint, there is a welcome plot twist involving Harge, who hires a private investigator to tape record Carol and Therese as they make love in the &quot; presidential suite&quot; of a cheap motel. <br/><br/>But what happens after that? Spoilers AHEAD. Carol goes back to Harge but eventually (wouldn&#39; t you know it?) is unable to shake her love and lust for dear Therese, and it&#39; s postulated at the climax that indeed they will once again reunite. The uncreative ending -- which really needed some kind of extraordinary twist -- leaves the two lovers staring at one another in a fancy hotel restaurant, as the screen fades to black. I suppose the non-stop &quot; passion&quot; between the two principals is what has seduced both critics and the average film-goer alike into declaring that this is some kind of masterpiece. But in reality Mr. Haynes should be applauded only for creating an impressive atmosphere— mere attraction (no matter how intense it is), is not enough for us to care about characters that are in need of much more detailed development.

"I can not say that A Walk to Remember was a movie that I went out of my way to see, or even that I recall it being aired in any UK cinema. I happened to watch it on TV one Sunday morning expecting something somewhat usual and predictable. <br/><br/>I must admit I was more than pleasantly surprised, enough so to actually watch it more than once, and consequently feel compelled to write these comments. I find myself struggling not to watch it whenever I see it listed, such a charming movie is this! The plot seems to be initially a rather predictable foray into the traditional territory of bad boy meets good, but sadly plain girl. At some point in the movie, girl momentarily transforms from ugly duckling into swan. At this point I found myself feeling that comfort that we all feel in the knowledge that we know exactly what is going to happen in a movie. I was entirely convinced that the entire culmination of the thing is for girl to gain some peer group acceptance. The presence of a seemingly overly protective father hints at overtones that he may be some kind of parental tyrant figure from whom she may require some sort of heroic liberation. <br/><br/>However as Jaime reveals her secret then all becomes apparent, and a far more absorbing plot unfolds than is initially to be expected. <br/><br/>Performances are competent and heartfelt, Shane West gives an admirable portrayal of an angry young man on a path of reformation. Mandy Moore is strong and almost graceful in her role as Jaime and enhances the charm of this romantic interlude with several pretty vocal solos. <br/><br/>Daryl Hannah and Peter Coyote both fine actors add a lovely depth to the general proceedings and are certainly worth a mention for their respective roles as concerned parents. <br/><br/>It is impossible for me not to like this little film, because I am an insufferably romantic female and A walk to Remember has romance in a monumental dosage. There is little or no sexual content, rather emphasis is put upon the more admirable and sincere aspects of courtship little seen in the average teen movie. <br/><br/>Without going into territory that could be classed as spoiling, it is worth mentioning that some people may place A Walk to Remember into the tear- jerker category, and consign it to a dark dusty corner of their DVD collection which is only delved into in the most girly of moments. <br/><br/>For some, several scenes may be a little too saccharine- but if you don&#39; t like romance then this picture probably isn&#39; t for you anyway. <br/><br/>In my opinion, this category is a little too narrow to slide A Walk to Remember into. The true themes of this lovely story are in reality- faith, and redemption, which are universal aspects of humanity with which we can all identify in various amount. <br/><br/>The end result for me was that I felt uplifted at the end. Like eating a tub of ice cream or having a nice bubbly bath this is a movie to put on when you feel low or have had a bad day and it&#39; s sure to make you feel much better. You will fall in love for the first time all over again for a couple of hours. <br/><br/>You may well sit down to watch with preconceptions about what you are going to see. You men may sit down and watch it solely to win a few merit points from your girlfriend so she&#39; ll let you watch the football in peace later. As my title says though, this may be the one romantic movie you will hate yourself for loving. <br/><br/>You don&#39; t even have to admit to anybody that you watched it and liked it, but I encourage you to watch it all the same without prejudice. <br/><br/>A little charmer- comforting and sweet- sets out to do something very simple, and delivers well, I give 7/10",7
"After a somewhat slow start I thought this movie about the Italian occupation of a Greek island during World War II picked up and became a quite enjoyable watch for a couple of hours, from primarily two points of view. <br/><br/>The love triangle is an interesting one and strikes me as believable, because I know it happened in various places under occupation. Penelope Cruz played Pelagia, a young Greek girl engaged to be married to Mandras (Christian Bale). I had questions about the depth of their love from the start, but their future was torn apart when Italy invaded Greece, and Mandras went off to fight. After German intervention, Greece is conquered and the island Pelagia lives on comes under Italian occupation, during which Pelagia meets and begins to fall in love with Captain Corelli (Nicholas Cage. ) This, of course, was a dilemma that came to many young women in occupied lands. As they got to know their occupiers, they started to see them not as the enemy but as real people, and sometimes fell in love - often to the disapproval of their neighbours. I just finished reading an interesting book about the German occupation of Britain&#39; s Channel Islands in which this was a major issue. Once Mandras returns to the island, Pelagia is torn between them. <br/><br/>The second background issue is the Italian occupation itself, which I thought was quite realistically portrayed. First was the contempt with which the island treated their Italian occupiers. Greece defeated Italy (quite true from a historical perspective) and was really conquered by the Germans. The refusal of the town to surrender to the Italians and instead to insist on surrendering to a German officer struck me as something that could well have happened (and was quite funny in fact. I loved the line, &quot; we would rather surrender to this German&#39; s dog than to you Italians. &quot; ) The portrayal of the Italian troops also struck me as believable. The Italian Army was never enamoured of their German ally, and never enthusiastic about fighting with them. Although Hitler and Mussolini were close friends, their soldiers tended to treat each other with contempt. Here, the Italians are more interested in singing than fighting (which the German troops on the island simply can&#39; t understand, ) and are ecstatic when Italy makes peace and withdraws from the war - until they discover that this may well make them prisoners of the Germans. It was all quite well done, I thought. <br/><br/>It falters a bit at the end with an all too predictable finish, but still deserves praise. <br/><br/>7/10",7
"Unlike many, I have not read the book and so I watched this purely as a film in its own right.  I&#39; m not especially keen on romance dramas, and I expected this to be a bit slushy and/or operatic so I was rather hesitant about going to see it in the first place. . . <br/><br/>But I&#39; m glad I did, because it was good.  Beautiful, &quot; feel good&quot; scenery and with a light touch of humour that made it rather more endearing than a straight drama would have been.  The romance was gentle, inoffensive and sufficiently interwoven with enough &quot; proper&quot; story-telling to keep my interest, and the score was not too obtrusively operatic. <br/><br/>
Overall, the film takes a satisfying circular route from start to finish, inducing a range of emotions as it progresses.  It&#39; s about 2 hours long, but I didn&#39; t find myself fidgeting or looking at my watch once - and that&#39; s quite a feat for me!!  Very enjoyable. ",6
"When I was watching this movie one thought had come to my mind for several times: &quot; It&#39; s not really what I expected, I thought it would be better&quot; , but now that I finished watching it I realize: why should I expect a better result from this movie? Isn&#39; t it just a &quot; love story&quot; made up in Hollywood show&#39; s standards? Of course, it is! If so, why expect more? <br/><br/>Captain Corelli&#39; s mandolin is a romance story in war time (WWII) and the plot which I was noticed about before watch the movie seemed very interesting to me. All that I didn&#39; t count was the &quot; Hollywood standard&#39; s&quot; touch. . . What I mean by this is that I expected a story a bit more realistic and with a stronger plot (which was not full of &quot; plot holes&quot; as this one is!) instead of this &quot; sweet story romance, with the perfect ending&quot; , which we&#39; re used to watch in a great part of Hollywood&#39; s movies! Another Hollywood standard&#39; s gaffe which is very common is the natives&#39; languages issue. The differences between Italian, Greek and German languages were all done just by a stupid accent, and all people seem to understand each other very well. The Italian and the German army arrive to a &quot; forgotten&quot; Greek island and they all understand each other very well as they all speak the same language! Of course it&#39; s just little technical details that don&#39; t even matter to the plot, but are all this little details which separate a good from a bad production! <br/><br/>But the movie has not just bad-sided arguments! On the good side, I can find the original idea (which comes from a book), and the thought that is possible to be Human, and have Human feelings, even inside a War. It&#39; s possible to sing and be happy, have good feelings, to love and to be loved in a War time! Was because of that main idea that I wanted to watch this movie, and at this particular point I wasn&#39; t disappointed! I just was dissatisfied about the way it was made! Another good-sided argument is History&#39; s knowledge The movie is not very deep at that issue, but it&#39; s good enough to have a little idea how was the WWII in the Eastern-South Europe. <br/><br/>Globally Captain Corelli&#39; s mandolin is not a bad movie but it&#39; s not as good as I initially though either, mostly because of the &quot; Hollywood show&#39; s standards&quot; up-mentioned. ",6
"(Spoilers throughout) Am I alone in thinking this film in many ways improves upon an excellent, if flawed, novel? Make no mistake: DeBernieres&#39; book is a modern classic, but it has two major weaknesses  one aesthetic, another of historical accuracy. This film nobly addresses both of these. <br/><br/>1) Captain Corelli&#39; s Mandolin is an excellent and moving novel. The idyllic pre-war life of the natives is vividly and touchingly depicted. The subsequent horrors of war are thus all the more harrowing when they finally arrive. <br/><br/>For all that, DeBernieres singularly fails to create a satisfactory conclusion. The last hundred pages or so detailing the intricacies of Pelagia&#39; s post-war existence are not uninteresting in themselves but seem banal indeed compared to the stirring drama that has come before. It is essentially a Second World War novel and should have ended with Corelli&#39; s departure from the island, or at least, soon after. The concluding chapters add nothing to the novel  DeBernieres should have been more ruthless and ended the story as soon as the main action stopped. The Great Escape would not have been improved by a concluding section about the surviving character&#39; s lives in the post-war decades and nor is this. <br/><br/>Commendably, the film improves upon this weakness. Now Corelli returns, soon after the war&#39; s end. This is a decided improvement on the novel where an ageing Corelli does not return  inexplicably  until fifty years later! It is thus far too late for him and Pelagia to get together and provides a wholly unsatisfactory outcome to the novel. <br/><br/>2) The novel is also undermined by a serious historical misrepresentation of the Greek anti-Nazi resistance movement, notably the organisation ELAS who Mandras falls in with. In the book, these are portrayed as Stalinist demagogues, more interested in the propagation of a narrow interpretation of Marxist dogma and political infighting with the British Allies, than genuinely resisting the Nazis. After the war, they are portrayed as practically being akin to the Nazi terror they supplant: <br/><br/>in Cephallonia the Communists began to deport awkward characters to concentration campsHitler would have been proud of such assiduous pupils. &#39; (p442). <br/><br/>As DeBernieres now grudgingly admits, in this respect, he got his research badly wrong. Although I am no expert on wartime Greece, by all accounts, ELAS played an active and constructive role in combating the Nazis. The film rectifies DeBernieres&#39; error, showing Mandras and the other guerrillas fighting the Nazis side by side with the Italians. This does involve a fairly major alteration in the novel&#39; s story line, however  Mandras&#39; s attempt at rape and subsequent death thus do not occur here, nor do any of his guerrilla experiences which are detailed throughout the middle stages of the book. <br/><br/>There were other changes in the film that I was less keen on, however. The role of the Italian soldier Carlo, who plays a fairly major part in the novel, is here almost wholly omitted, presumably because of fears that his homosexuality would offend the crucial American market. His gesture in saving Corelli from the firing squad is thus largely inexplicable, except as  rather lamely  a benevolent sacrifice towards Pelagia. <br/><br/>On the other hand, CCM is such a long and complex novel that one can forgive the film makers for not transcribing every aspect of the book to the screen. Film is a different medium to literature. The unfairly hostile critical reception this film has received suggests far too many expected a carbon copy of the novel to be revealed on film. (And as Madden also directed the generally awful but highly overrated Shakespeare in Love perhaps this evens the score somewhat). <br/><br/>That said, the film is not perfect. I am not convinced Cage was the ideal Captain Corelli. The depiction of village life does come across fairly whimsically and compares poorly to the portrayal of European rural life in the 1940s in Jean De Florette. Although I&#39; ve said changes from the book are not bad per se, some of the changes  the date of the earthquake from 1953 to 1947 seemed rather pointless. But generally ignore the pedants. The film would not be improved either by a) forcing the cast to learn and speak their character&#39; s native languages and subtitling throughout or b) correcting such &#39; inaccuracies&#39; as the Italians occupying the island for two years (er - they did) or b) depicting Abyssinian style atrocities committed by the Italian forces on the island (none recorded). While not quite in the class of other Second World War classics like Empire of the Sun, Schindler&#39; s List or The Bridge on the River Kwai, this is generally a good film. ",6
"A very poor acting and lack of identity characterises this film. Penelope Cruz avoids expressing any kind of feeling, even that of love and she keeps having that extremely serious look on her face. Nicolas Cage on the contrary expresses his feelings so intensely that he becomes unbelievable; it&#39; s like saying &quot; look, now I am a man who&#39; s happy for no apparent reason&quot; or &quot; now I am horrofied by Germans&#39; brutallity&quot; . However, Irene Pappas was unique as the Greek mother and John Hurt as Pelagia&#39; s father. I also enjoyed Emilios Chilakis in his very short appearance as the Greek guerilla: he talked in a very determined way as a man who has decided not to surrender should talk. However, even though the represantation of the specifique era was quite good, hardly as the actors try, they don&#39; t succeed in their roles of the locals (needless to say that Greeks actors are excluded). The pronunciation was a very big disadvantage: Pelagia spoke English with a Spanish pronunciation, Correli spoke English sometimes with bad italian accent, sometimes with perfect american accent; however he can also speak perfect German and he can read a text written in Greek!!! And the story goes on with that multi-language mess. Also, watching the film you can hardly believe that there is a war going on: It seems that Greece had no problems during the Occupation (by the Germans and the Italians), since Italian soldiers were here to enjoy the sun. Thank God that Germans arrive on the island and we start to remember that we are during a war. And yet, the director makes it appear as if Italians and Greeks were allies against the German enemy. People of Cephalonia fought really hard against Itallians and Germans and many of them were executed; but it seems as if Italians fought for the shake of Greeks while the later were enjoying the italian music. Besides, there was a very poor reprasantation of fight and bombing. And during that events, Pelagia found the time to fall in love with Corelli, before we could realise it: She seems more in love with Mandras than with Corelli and she has hardly exchange a complete and meaningful dialogue with him; however she can&#39; t live without him. The director actually does focus neither on war events nor on the love affair and that ruins the movie. Also, I can&#39; t avoid mentioning that I got tired of watching Pelagia walking around with a basket. I assure you that women had much more to do even in that time of &#39; 40&#39; s. <br/><br/>***SPOILER*** Can someone explain to me why the guerillas executed Eleni (Pelagia&#39; s friend) for simply kissing a German on the cheek and Mandras denies even his mother&#39; s request to save her, while Pelagia (who had a love affair with an Italian soldier and everybody Knows it) has their help and approval?<br/><br/>Finish studing Medicine in two years? That&#39; s a record!",4
"Not having read past the first chapter of the book I was happy to judge this film entirely on its own merits rather than comparing it with the well-known novel. Almost, anyway - the first chapter I remember was hilarious - yet the momentum is sadly lacking in the opening scene which dismisses the humour within seconds. World War II approaches and Germany and Mussolini invade Greece. Nicolas Cage, as the unconvincing Italian captain who is more attuned to singing than warfare, demonstrates quite admirably that this is the sort of film he should leave well alone. Penelope Cruz, as the Greek girl betrothed to another but who falls in love with Cage is slightly better, but not enough to lift this bland and syrupy film above mediocrity. The rest of acting is fairly wooden, most of the script quite predictable, and the moral ambiguities of fighting for the &#39; right&#39; side barely touched. The ending is unsatisfactory, as if we are expected to wait a couple of years and part with more money for part two. Part one didn&#39; t hold enough promise - the tedium and self-adoration in the photography and music failed to justify a film of over two hours that could have risen (but fell) on its own merits and lack of them, but it will most surely disappoint the many fans of what is reputedly an excellent novel.
